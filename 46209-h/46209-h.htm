<h3><a name="DIARIES" id="DIARIES">DIARIES.</a></h3>
<p class='align-right-indent'><span class="smcap">Thursday, 1.</span></p>

<p>Come again into my study, having sat some time
for greater comfort in the sunnier east room by
an open fire, as needful in our climate, almost, as in
that of changeable England. Busy days these last,
with a little something to show for them. After all,
I am here most at home, and myself surrounded by
friendly pictures and books, free to follow the mood of
the moment,&mdash;read, write, recreate. I wish more came
of it all. Here are these voluminous diaries, showy seen
from without, with far too little of life transcribed
within. Was it the accident of being shown, when a
boy, in the old oaken cabinet, my mother's little journal,
that set me out in this chase of myself, continued almost
uninterruptedly, and now fixed by habit as a part of
the day, like the rising and setting of the sun? Yet it
has educated me into whatever skill I possess with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
pen, I know not to how much besides; has made me
emulous of attaining the art of portraying my thoughts,
occupations, surroundings, friendships; and could I succeed
in sketching to the life a single day's doings, should
esteem myself as having accomplished the chiefest feat
in literature. Yet the nobler the life and the busier,
the less, perhaps, gets written, and that which is, the
less rewards perusal.</p>

<h3><a name="MY_HOUSE" id="MY_HOUSE">MY HOUSE.</a></h3>

<p class='align-right-indent'><span class="smcap">Saturday, 3.</span></p>

<p>My neighbors flatter me in telling me that I have
one of the best placed and most picturesque
houses in our town. I know very well the secret of
what they praise. 'Tis simply adapting the color and
repairs to the architecture, and holding these in keeping
with the spot.</p>

<p>A house, like a person, invites by amiable reserves,
as if it loved to be introduced in perspective and reached
by courteous approaches. Let it show bashfully behind
shrubberies, screen its proportions decorously in plain
tints, not thrust itself rudely, like an inn, upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
street at cross-roads. A wide lawn in front, sloping to
the road gracefully, gives it the stately air and courtly
approach. I like the ancient mansions for this reason;
these old Puritan residences for their unpretending air,
their sober tints, in strict keeping with Wordsworth's
rule of coloring, viz. that of the sod about the grounds.
A slight exaltation of this defines best the architecture
by distinguishing it from surrounding objects in the
landscape. Modest tints are always becoming. White
and red intolerable. And for some variety in dressing,
the neighboring barks of shrubbery suggest and best
characterize the coloring.</p>

<p>As for fences and gates, I was told that mine were
unlike any other in the world, yet as good as anybody's,
hereby meaning to praise them, I infer. If less durable
than others, the cost is inconsiderable, and has the
associated pleasure, besides, of having come out of such
ideal capital as I had invested in my own head and
hands. A common carpenter would have spent more
time in planing and fixing his pickets and set something
in straight lines with angular corners to deform
the landscape; then the painter must have followed
with some tint mixed neither by nature nor art. Now
my work delights my eyes whenever I step out-of-doors,
adding its ornament to the spot. Grotesque it may be
with its knotted ornaments, Druid supports, yet in keeping
with the woods behind it. Besides, what pleasure the
construction has given! Form, color, ornamentation
alike concern builder and occupant, as they were blossoms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of his taste and of the landscape. A good architect
is both builder and colorist, and should be a good
man besides, according to the ancient authorities.
Roman Vitruvius claims as much, if not more, of
him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is necessary," he says, "that an architect should
be instructed in the precepts of moral philosophy; for
he ought to have a great soul, and be bold without
arrogance, just, faithful, and totally exempt from
avarice. He should have a great docility, which may
hinder him from neglecting the advice that is given
him, not only of the meanest artist, but also of those
that understand nothing of architecture; for not only
architects but all the world must judge his works."</p>

<p>Houses have their history, are venerable on account
of their age and origin. Even our newly-settled country
of but a century or two has already crowned homesteads
still standing with royal honors. Mine, I conjecture,
is not far from one hundred and fifty years'
standing. It was a first-class country house in its day,
with its window-seats in parlor and chambers, ornamental
summers and casements, its ample fireplaces,
and lean-to on the northern side. Like most of its
period it was open to the road with overshadowing elms
still embowering the mansion; had a lion-headed door-knocker,
and huge chimney-tops surmounting the gables.
Of learned ancestry, moreover; having been the homestead
of a brother of President Hoar, of Harvard College,
and remained in possession of members of that venerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
family down to near the beginning of the present century.
The site is hardly surpassed by any on the old
Boston road; the woods behind crowning the range of
hills running north almost to the village, and bordering
east on Wayside, Hawthorne's last residence. It must
have been chosen by an original settler, probably coming
with the Rev. Peter Bulkeley from England, in 1635.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>The ancient elms before the house, of a hundred
years' standing and more, are the pride of the yard.
It were sacrilege to remove a limb or twig unless decayed,
so luxuriant and far-spreading, overshadowing
the roof and gables, yet admitting the light into hall
and chambers. Sunny rooms, sunny household.
"Build your house," says a mystic author, "upon a
firm foundation, and let your aspect be towards the
east, where the sun rises, that so you may enjoy its
fruitfulness in your household and orchards."</p>

<p>Whether the first settler planted these elms, or
whether they are survivors of the primitive forest
which was felled to make way and room for the rude
shelter of the hardy settlers, is not ascertained. Their
roots penetrate primitive soil; the surrounding grounds
have become productive by the industry and skill,
mellowed and meliorated by the humanities of their
descendants. They came honestly by their homesteads,
paying their swarthy claimants fair prices for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
them; the landscape is still inviting by its prairie aspects,
its brook-sides and meadows where the red men
trod.</p>

<p>It was these broad meadows beside the "Grass
ground River" that tempted alike the white and red
man,&mdash;the one for pasturage, the other for fishing,&mdash;and
brought the little colony through the wilderness to
form the settlement named "Musketaquid," after the
river of that name (signifying grass ground), and later
taking that of Concord, not without note in history.</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class="poetry">
<p class='verse'>"Beneath low hills, in the broad interval</p>
<p class='verse'>Through which at will our Indian rivulet</p>
<p class='verse'>Winds mindful still of sannup and of squaw,</p>
<p class='verse'>Whose pipe and arrow oft the plough unburies;</p>
<p class='verse'>Here, in pine houses, built of new-fallen trees,</p>
<p class='verse'>Supplanters of the tribe, the planters dwelt."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The view from the rustic seat overlooking my house
commands the amphitheatre in which the house stands,
and through which flows Mill brook, bordered on the
south and east by the Lincoln woods. It is a quiet
prospect and might be taken for an English landscape;
needs but a tower or castle overtopping the trees
surrounding it. The willows by the rock bridge
over the brook, the winding lane once the main track
of travel before the turnpike branching off from the old
Boston road by Emerson's door was built, adds to the
illusion, while on the east stands the pine-clad hill,
Hawthorne's favorite haunt, and hiding his last residence
from sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
On the southwest is an ancient wood, Thoreau's
pride, beyond which is Walden Pond, distant about a
mile from my house, and best reached by the lane
opening opposite Hawthorne's. Fringed on all sides
by woods, the interval, once a mill pond, is now
in meadow and garden land, the slopes planted in
vineyards, market gardens and orchards lining the
road along which stand the farmers' houses visible
in the opening.</p>

<p>This road has more than a local interest. If any
road may claim the originality of being entitled to the
name of American, it is this,&mdash;since along its dust
the British regulars retreated from their memorable
repulse at the Old North Bridge, the Concord military
following fast upon their heels, and from the hill-tops
giving them salutes of musketry till they disappeared
beyond Lexington, and gave a day to history.</p>

<p>An agricultural town from the first, it is yet such
in large measure; though like others in its neighborhood
becoming suburban and commercial. Fields
once in corn and grass are now in vineyards and
orchards, tillage winding up the slopes from the
low lands to the hill-tops. The venerable woods
once crowning these are fast falling victims to the axe.
The farmsteads are no longer the rural homes they
were when every member of the family took part in
domestic affairs; foreign help serves where daughters
once served; they with their brothers having left the
housekeeping and farming for school, factories, trade,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
a profession, and things are drifting towards an urbane
and municipal civilization, the metropolis extending
its boundaries, and absorbing the townships for many
miles round.</p>

<p>Moreover, the primitive features of the landscape
are being obliterated by the modern facilities for business
and travel, less perhaps than in most places lying
so near the metropolis; the social still less than the
natural; the descendants of the primitive fathers
of the settlement cherishing a pride of ancestry not
unbecoming in a republic, less favorable for the perpetuation
of family distinctions and manners than in
countries under monarchical rule.</p>

<p class='align-right-indent'><span class="smcap">Monday, 5.</span></p>

<p>One's outlook is a part of his virtue. Does it matter
nothing to him what objects accost him whenever
he glances from his windows, or steps out-of-doors? He
who is so far weaned from the landscape, or indifferent
to it, as not to derive a sweet and robust habit of character
therefrom, seems out of keeping with nature and
himself. I suspect something amiss in him who has no
love, no enthusiasm for his surroundings, and that his
friendships, if such he profess, are of a cold and
isolate quality at best; one even questions, at times,
whether the residents of cities, where art has thrown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
around them a world of its own, are compensated by
all this luxury of display,&mdash;to say nothing of the social
artifices wont to steal into their costly compliments,&mdash;for
the simple surroundings of the countryman, which
prompt to manliness and true gentility. A country
dwelling without shrubbery, hills near or in the distance,
a forest and water view, if but a rivulet, seems
so far incomplete as if the occupants themselves were
raw and impoverished. Wood and water god both, man
loves to traverse the forests, wade the streams, and confess
his kindred alliance with primeval things. He
leaps not from the woods into civility at a single bound,
neither comes from cities and conversations freed from
the wildness of his dispositions. Something of the forester
stirs within him when occasion provokes, as if men
were trees transformed, and delighted to claim their
affinities with their sylvan ancestry.</p>

<h4>THOREAU.</h4>

<p>My friend and neighbor united these qualities of sylvan
and human in a more remarkable manner than any
whom it has been my happiness to know. Lover of the
wild, he lived a borderer on the confines of civilization,
jealous of the least encroachment upon his possessions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
I had never thought of knowing a man so thoroughly
of the country, and so purely a son of nature. I think
he had the profoundest passion for it of any one of his
time; and had the human sentiment been as tender and
pervading, would have given us pastorals of which
Virgil and Theocritus might have envied him the authorship
had they chanced to be his contemporaries.
As it was, he came nearer the antique spirit than any
of our native poets, and touched the fields and groves
and streams of his native town with a classic interest
that shall not fade. Some of his verses are suffused
with an elegiac tenderness, as if the woods and brooks
bewailed the absence of their Lycidas, and murmured
their griefs meanwhile to one another,&mdash;responsive like
idyls. Living in close companionship with nature, his
muse breathed the spirit and voice of poetry. For
when the heart is once divorced from the senses and all
sympathy with common things, then poetry has fled and
the love that sings.</p>

<p>The most welcome of companions was this plain
countryman. One seldom meets with thoughts like his,
coming so scented of mountain and field breezes and
rippling springs, so like a luxuriant clod from under
forest leaves, moist and mossy with earth-spirits. His
presence was tonic, like ice water in dog-days to the
parched citizen pent in chambers and under brazen
ceilings. Welcome as the gurgle of brooks and dipping
of pitchers,&mdash;then drink and be cool! He seemed
one with things, of nature's essence and core, knit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
strong timbers,&mdash;like a wood and its inhabitants.
There was in him sod and shade, wilds and waters
manifold,&mdash;the mould and mist of earth and sky.
Self-poised and sagacious as any denizen of the elements,
he had the key to every animal's brain, every
plant; and were an Indian to flower forth and reveal the
scents hidden in his cranium, it would not be more surprising
than the speech of our Sylvanus. He belonged
to the Homeric age,&mdash;was older than pastures and
gardens, as if he were of the race of heroes and one
with the elements. He of all men seemed to be the
native New-Englander, as much so as the oak, the
granite ledge; our best sample of an indigenous American,
untouched by the old country, unless he came
down rather from Thor, the Northman, whose name he
bore.</p>

<p>A peripatetic philosopher, and out-of-doors for the
best part of his days and nights, he had manifold
weather and seasons in him; the manners of an animal
of probity and virtue unstained. Of all our moralists,
he seemed the wholesomest, the busiest, and the best
republican citizen in the world; always at home minding
his own affairs. A little over-confident by genius,
and stiffly individual, dropping society clean out of his
theories, while standing friendly in his strict sense of
friendship, there was in him an integrity and love of
justice that made possible and actual the virtues
of Sparta and the Stoics,&mdash;all the more welcome
in his time of shuffling and pusillanimity. Plutarch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
would have made him immortal in his pages had he
lived before his day. Nor have we any so modern
withal, so entirely his own and ours: too purely so to be
appreciated at once. A scholar by birthright, and an
author, his fame had not, at his decease, travelled far
from the banks of the rivers he described in his books;
but one hazards only the truth in affirming of his prose,
that in substance and pith, it surpasses that of any
naturalist of his time; and he is sure of large reading in
the future. There are fairer fishes in his pages than
any swimming in our streams; some sleep of his
on the banks of the Merrimack by moonlight that
Egypt never rivalled; a morning of which Memnon
might have envied the music, and a greyhound he once
had, meant for Adonis; frogs, better than any of
Aristophanes; apples wilder than Adam's. His
senses seemed double, giving him access to secrets not
easily read by others; in sagacity resembling that of
the beaver, the bee, the dog, the deer; an instinct
for seeing and judging, as by some other, or seventh
sense; dealing with objects as if they were shooting
forth from his mind mythologically, thus completing
the world all round to his senses; a creation of his at
the moment. I am sure he knew the animals one by
one, as most else knowable in his town; the plants,
the geography, as Adam did in his Paradise, if,
indeed, he were not that ancestor himself. His
works are pieces of exquisite sense, celebrations of
Nature's virginity exemplified by rare learning, delicate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
art, replete with observations as accurate as original;
contributions of the unique to the natural history
of his country, and without which it were incomplete.
Seldom has a head circumscribed so much of the sense
and core of Cosmos as this footed intelligence.</p>

<p>If one would learn the wealth of wit there was in
this plain man, the information, the poetry, the piety,
he should have accompanied him on an afternoon walk
to Walden, or elsewhere about the skirts of his village
residence. Pagan as he might outwardly appear, yet he
was the hearty worshipper of whatsoever is sound and
wholesome in nature,&mdash;a piece of russet probity and
strong sense, that nature delighted to own and honor.
His talk was suggestive, subtle, sincere, under as many
masks and mimicries as the shows he might pass; as
significant, substantial,&mdash;nature choosing to speak
through his mouth-piece,&mdash;cynically, perhaps, and
searching into the marrows of men and times he
spoke of, to his discomfort mostly and avoidance.</p>

<p>Nature, poetry, life,&mdash;not politics, not strict science,
not society as it is,&mdash;were his preferred themes. The
world was holy, the things seen symbolizing the things
unseen, and thus worthy of worship, calling men out-of-doors
and under the firmament for health and wholesomeness
to be insinuated into their souls, not as idolators,
but as idealists. His religion was of the most
primitive type, inclusive of all natural creatures and
things, even to "the sparrow that falls to the ground,"
though never by shot of his, and for whatsoever was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
manly in men, his worship was comparable to that of
the priests and heroes of all time. I should say he
inspired the sentiment of love, if, indeed, the sentiment
did not seem to partake of something purer, were
that possible, but nameless from its excellency. Certainly
he was better poised and more nearly self-reliant
than other men.</p>

<p class='verse'>Round which, when he his walk did take,</p>
<p class='verse'>Thought he performed far more than Drake;</p>
<p class='verse'>For other lands he took less thought</p>
<p class='verse'>Than this his muse and mother brought."</p>
</div></div>

<p>More primitive and Homeric than any American, his
style of thinking was robust, racy, as if Nature herself
had built his sentences and seasoned the sense of his
paragraphs with her own vigor and salubrity. Nothing
can be spared from them; there is nothing superfluous;
all is compact, concrete, as nature is.</p>

<p>His politics were of a piece with his individualism.
We must admit that he found little in political or religious
establishments answering to his wants, that his
attitude was defiant, if not annihilating, as if he had
said to himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The state is man's pantry at most, and filled at an
enormous cost,&mdash;a spoliation of the human commonwealth.
Let it go. Heroes can live on nuts, and freemen
sun themselves in the clefts of rocks, rather than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
sell their liberty for this pottage of slavery. We, the
few honest neighbors, can help one another; and should
the state ask any favors of us, we can take the matter
into consideration leisurely, and at our convenience
give a respectful answer.</p>

<p>"But why require a state to protect one's rights? the
man is all. Let him husband himself; needs he other
servant or runner? Self-keeping is the best economy.
That is a great age when the state is nothing and man
is all. He founds himself in freedom, and maintains
his uprightness therein; founds an empire and maintains
states. Just retire from those concerns, and see how
soon they must needs go to pieces, the sooner for the
virtue thus withdrawn from them. All the manliness
of individuals is sunk in that partnership in trade. Not
only must I come out of institutions, but come out of
myself, if I will be free and independent. Shall one be
denied the privilege on coming of mature age of choosing
whether he will be a citizen of the country he happens to
be born in, or another? And what better title to a spot
of ground than being a man, and having none? Is not
man superior to state or country? I plead exemption
from all interference by men or states with my individual
prerogatives. That is mine which none can steal
from me, nor is that yours which I or any man can take
away."</p>

A famous speech is recorded of an old Norseman
thoroughly characteristic of this Teuton. "I believe
neither in idols nor demons; I put my sole trust in my
own strength of body and soul." The ancient crest of
a pick-axe, with the motto, "Either I will find a way or
make one," characterizes the same sturdy independence
and practical materialism which distinguishes the descendants
of Thor, whose symbol was a hammer.</p>

<p>He wrote in his Journal:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am descended from the Northman named
Thorer, the dog-footed. He was the most powerful man
of the North. To judge from his name, <em>Thorer Hund</em>
belonged to the same family. Thorer is one of the
most, if not the most common name in the chronicles
of the Northmen. Sn&ouml;rro Sturleson says, 'from Thor's
name comes Thorer, also Thorarimnn.' Again, 'Earl
Rognvald was King Harald's dearest friend, and the king
had the greatest regard for him. He was married to
Hilda, a daughter of Rolf Nalfia, and their sons were
Rolf and Thorer. Rolf became a great Viking, and
of so stout a growth that no horse could carry him, and
wheresoever he went, he went on foot, and therefore
he was called Gange-Rolf.' Laing says in a note, what
Sturleson also tells in the text, 'Gange-Rolf, Rolf-Ganger,
Rolf the walker, was the conqueror of Normandy.
Gange-Rolf's son was William, father of
Richard, who was the father of Richard Longspear,
and grandfather of William the Bastard, from whom
the following English kings are descended.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
"King Harald set Earl Rognvald's son Thorer over
M&ouml;re, and gave him his daughter Alof in marriage.
Thorer, called the Silent, got the same territory his
father Rognvald had possessed. His brother Einar
going into battle to take vengeance on his father's
murderers, sang a kind of reproach against his brothers,
Rollang and Rolf, for their slowness, and concludes:&mdash;</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>'And silent Thorer sits and dreams</p>
<p class='verse'>At home, beside the mead bowl's streams.'</p>
</div></div>

<p>"Of himself it is related, that 'he cut a spread eagle
on the back of his enemy Halfdan.'</p>

<p>"So it seems that from one branch of the family were
descended the kings of England, and from the other,
myself."</p>

<p>In his journal I find these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class="poetry">
<p class='verse'>"Light-headed, thoughtless, shall I take my way</p>
<p class='verse'>When I to Thee this being have resigned;</p>

<p class='note'><span class="smcap">Note</span>. "Thoreau was born in Concord on the 12th of July, 1817. The old-fashioned
house, its roof nearly reaching to the ground in the rear, remains
as it was when he first saw the light in the easternmost of its upper chambers.
It was the residence of his grandmother, and a perfect piece of our
New-England style of building, with its gray, unpainted boards, its grassy,
unfenced door-yard. The house is somewhat isolate and remote from
thoroughfares. The Virginia road is an old-fashioned, winding, at length
deserted pathway, the more smiling for its forked orchards, tumbling walks,
and mossy banks. About the house are pleasant, sunny meadows, deep
with their beds of peat, so cheering with its homely, heath-like fragrance,
and in its front runs a constant stream through the centre of that great tract
sometimes called 'Bedford Levels,'&mdash;this brook a source of the Shawsheen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
River. It was lovely that he should draw his first breath in a pure country
air, out of crowded towns, amid the pleasant russet fields.</p>

<p class='note'>"His parents were active, vivacious people; his grandfather, by his father's
side, coming from the Isle of Jersey, a Frenchman and Catholic, who married
a Scotch woman named Jennie Burns. On his mother's side the descent
is from the well-known Jones family of Weston, Mass., and the Rev. Charles
Dunbar, a graduate of Harvard College, who preached in Salem, and at
length settled in Keene, New Hampshire. As variable an ancestry as can
well be afforded, with marked family characters on both sides. About a
year and a half from Henry's birth, the family removed to the town of
Chelmsford, thence to Boston, coming back, however, to Concord when he
was of a very tender age; his earliest memory of most of the town was a
ride to Walden Pond with his grandmother, when he thought that he should
be glad to live there. He retained a peculiar pronunciation of the letter R,
with a decided French accent. He says, 'September is the fifth month with
a burr in it.' His great-grandmother's name was Marie le Galais, and his
grandfather, John Thoreau, was baptized April 28, 1754, and partook of the
Catholic sacrament in the parish of St. Helier, Isle of Jersey, in May, 1773.
Thus near to old France and the church was our Yankee boy.</p>

<p class='note'>"A moment may be spent on a few traits of Thoreau, of a personal kind.
In height he was about the average. In his build, spare, with limbs that
were rather longer than usual, or of which he made a longer use. His face
once seen could not be forgotten; the features quite marked, the nose aquiline,
or very Roman, like one of the portraits of C&aelig;sar (more like a beak,
as was said), large overhanging brows above the deepest-set blue eyes that
could be seen,&mdash;blue in certain lights, and in others gray,&mdash;eyes expressive
of all shades of feeling, but never weak or near-sighted; the forehead not
unusually broad or high, full of concentrated energy and purpose; the
mouth, with prominent lips, pursed up with meaning and thought when shut,
and giving out when open a stream of the most varied and unusual and
instructive sayings. His hair was a dark brown, exceedingly abundant,
fine, and soft, and for several years he wore a comely beard. His whole
figure had an active earnestness as if he had not a moment to waste. The
clenched hand betokened purpose. In walking he made a short cut if he
could, and when sitting in the shade, or by the wall-side, seemed merely the
clearer to look forward into the next piece of activity. Even in the boat he
had a wary, transitory air, his eyes on the lookout; perhaps there might
be ducks, or the Blondin turtle, or an otter, or sparrow. He was a plain
man in his features and dress,&mdash;one who could not be mistaken, and this
kind of plainness is not out of keeping with beauty. He sometimes went as
far as homeliness, which again, even if there be a prejudice against it, shines
out at times beyond a vulgar beauty."</p>

<p>For a diary, slight arches will suffice to convey the
day's freight across; the lighter these, the speedier
and more graceful the transit. Any current event,
passing thought, rumor, were transportable, if simply
dispatched. And the more significant, as the more familiar
and private. Life were the less sweet and companionable
if cumbered with affairs, overloaded with
thought, dizzied with anxieties. Better the quiet temper
that takes the days as they pass, and as if an eternity
were vouchsafed for completing one's task, the time
too short to waste in murmurs or postponements.</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>"Cares, like eclipses, darken our endeavors;</p>
<p class='verse'>Our duties are our best gods."</p>
</div></div>

<p>A quiet life furnishes little of incident; dealing with
thoughts and things in a meditative manner, it has the
less for those who have a more stirring stake in current
affairs. Yet one fancies that what interests himself
may interest others of like mind, if not of like
pursuits; and more especially when, as in a diary, he
writes only of what has some real or imagined relation
to what concerns him. His record may be careless,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
inconsequent, like the days it chronicles, with but the
slender thread of sleep connecting its leaves; or perhaps
the newspaper, once an accident, and coming irregularly,
links his evening with morning, morning with
evening; newspaper before breakfast, before business,
before sleep; daily bread. One almost defines his
culture, his social standing, by the journals he takes.
Observe the difference between persons and neighborhoods
familiar with current newspapers and those who
are not. Very different from the times when a country
boy must ride his miles after his Saturday's work to get
some glimmering of what was passing in the great world
around him; before libraries and lectures were established,
steam and lightning were carriers and couriers
for all mankind. No life is insular now. Every
thought resounds throughout the globe. Electricity
competes with thought in the race. The telegraph,
locomotive, the press, render cabinets and colleges
almost superfluous. Travel makes all men countrymen,
makes people noblemen and kings, every man tasting
of liberty and dominion. And who but the kings themselves
can unking themselves?</p>

<p>Still, like most things, our periodical literature is far
from being a pure benefit, and one may quote Plato's
saying as applicable to the superficial culture which this
of itself fosters: "Total ignorance were in no wise a
thing so vile and wicked, nor the greatest of evils; but
multifarious knowledge and learning acquired under bad
management, causes much more harm."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Rather what is thought and spoken in drawing-rooms,
clubs, in private assemblies, best intimates the spirit and
tendencies of a community. Things are known but at
second-hand as represented in public prints, or spoken
on platforms. Admitted to private houses, one may
report accurately the census of civility, and cast the
horoscope of the coming time. Nor do I sympathize
with some of my friends in their dislike of reporters.
One defends himself from intrusion, as a general rule;
but where the public have a generous interest in one's
thoughts, his occupations and manners, the discourtesy
is rather in withholding these from any false
modesty. Besides, the version is more likely to be
nearer the truth than if left to chance curiosity,
which piques itself all the more on getting what
was thus withheld, with any additions the mood
favors.</p>

<p class='align-right-indent'><span class="smcap">Sunday, 11.</span></p>

<p>The course of Sunday lectures at Horticultural Hall
opened in January closes to-day. They have
proved a brilliant success. Each speaker has attracted,
besides the body of steady attendants, his personal
friends, thus varying the audiences from Sunday to Sunday,
and giving an example of varied teaching unprecedented
in our time. The reports of these discourses,
imperfect as they are, deserve preservation. They have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
relation to the drift of thinking in our New-England
community especially, and are of historical importance.
If not accepting all that has been spoken on this platform
by the successive speakers, one may take a hearty
interest in these adventures into the world of thought
and duty; nor can any who have attended steadily from
Sunday to Sunday question their serving a religious
need of the time. The views of persons, distinguished
as are most of the speakers, are not insignificant, since
these are not among the least of the influences secretly,
if not openly, moulding the manners and institutions of
a community in which the thoughts and aims of the
humblest individuals have weight, and the young are
so eager to learn of their thoughtful elders.</p>

<p>When I recollect the ardor with which I sought the
acquaintance of those whom I imagined had ideas to
communicate, and my delight in such when found, I
am led to think how very desirable were an institution
to which young students might resort during such portion
of the year as might be most convenient, to enjoy
the fellowship of some of our most cultivated persons,&mdash;scholarships
being provided for such as had not the
means of defraying the necessary expenses,&mdash;thus
enabling bright young men and women, whether college
graduates or not, to complete what colleges do not
give. Not every student comes into that intellectual
sympathy with his professor, which renders instruction
most enjoyable, yet without which the highest ends of
culture are not attained. With a faculty composed of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
persons whose names a moment's thought will suggest,
opportunities would be given for that sympathetic
communion of mind with mind in which all living
instruction and influence consist.</p>

<h3><a name="EMERSON" id="EMERSON">EMERSON.</a></h3>

<p class='align-right-indent'><span class="smcap">Tuesday, 13.</span></p>

<p>Emerson has lately completed a course of readings
on English Poetry to an appreciative company
in Boston. It is a variation of his method of
communicating with his companies, and not less becoming
than even his usual form of lecture. It matters
not in his case; for such is the charm of his manner,
that wherever he appears, the cultured class will delight
in his utterances; and one may quote Socrates in
Ph&aelig;drus, where Plato makes him say, "For as men lead
hungry creatures by holding out a green bough, or an
apple, so you, Ph&aelig;drus, it would seem, might lead me
about all Attica, and, indeed, wherever else you please,
by extending to me discourses out of your books." Not
less aptly Goethe describes him, in his letters to Schiller,
where he calls the rhapsodist, "A wise man, who, in
calm thoughtfulness, shows what has happened; his
discourse aiming less to excite than to calm his auditors,
in order that they shall listen to him with contentment
and long. He apportions the interest equally, because
it is not in his power to balance a too lively impression.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
He grasps backwards and forwards at pleasure. He is
followed, because he has only to do with the imagination,
which of itself produces images, and which, up to a
certain degree, is indifferent what kind he calls up. He
does not appear to his auditors, but recites, as it were,
behind a curtain; so there is a total abstraction from
himself, and it seems to them as though they heard only
the voice of the Muses."</p>

<p>See our Ion standing there, his audience, his manuscript
before him, himself also an auditor, as he reads, of
the Genius sitting behind him, and to whom he defers,
eagerly catching the words,&mdash;the words,&mdash;as if the
accents were first reaching his ears too, and entrancing
alike oracle and auditor. We admire the stately sense,
the splendor of diction, and are charmed as we listen.
Even his hesitancy between the delivery of his periods,
his perilous passages from paragraph to paragraph of
manuscript, we have almost learned to like, as if he
were but sorting his keys meanwhile for opening his
cabinets; the spring of locks following, himself seeming
as eager as any of us to get sight of his specimens
as they come forth from their proper drawers, and we
wait willingly till his gem is out glittering; admire the
setting, too, scarcely less than the jewel itself. The
magic minstrel and speaker, whose rhetoric, voiced as
by organ-stops, delivers the sentiment from his breast
in cadences peculiar to himself; now hurling it forth on
the ear, echoing; then, as his mood and matter invite,
dying away, like</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>
<p class='indent4'>"Music of mild lutes,</p>
<p class='indent4'>Or silver-coated flutes,</p>
<p class='verse'>Or the concealing winds that can convey</p>
<p class='verse'>Never their tone to the rude ear of day."</p>
</div></div>

<p>He works his miracles with it, as Hermes did, his
voice conducting the sense alike to eye and ear by its
lyrical movement and refraining melody. So his compositions
affect us, not as logic linked in syllogisms,
but as voluntaries rather, as preludes, in which one is
not tied to any design of air, but may vary his key or
note at pleasure, as if improvised without any particular
scope of argument; each period, paragraph, being
a perfect note in itself, however it may chance chime
with its accompaniments in the piece, as a waltz of
wandering stars, a dance of Hesperus with Orion. His
rhetoric dazzles by its circuits, contrasts, antitheses;
imagination, as in all sprightly minds, being his wand
of Power. He comes along his own paths, too, and
in his own fashion. What though he build his
piers downwards from the firmament to the tumbling
tides, and so throw his radiant span across the fissures
of his argument, and himself pass over the frolic
arches, Ariel-wise,&mdash;is the skill less admirable, the
masonry the less secure for its singularity? So his
books are best read as irregular writings, in which the
sentiment is, by his enthusiasm, transfused throughout
the piece, telling on the mind in cadences of a current
undersong, giving the impression of a connected whole,&mdash;which
it seldom is,&mdash;such is the rhapsodist's cunning
in its structure and delivery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
The highest compliment we can pay the scholar is
that of having edified and instructed us, we know not
how, unless by the pleasure his words have given us.
Conceive how much the lyceum owes to his presence
and teachings; how great the debt of many to him for
their hour's entertainment. His, if any one's, let the
institution pass into history, since his art, more than
another's, has clothed it with beauty, and made it the
place of popular resort, our purest organ of intellectual
entertainment for New England and the Western cities.
And besides this, its immediate value to his auditors
everywhere, it has been serviceable in ways they least
suspect; most of his works, having had their first readings
on its platform, were here fashioned and polished,
in good part, like Plutarch's morals, to become the more
acceptable to readers of his published books. Does
it matter what topic he touches? He adorns all with
a severe sententious beauty, a freshness and sanction
next to that of godliness, if not that in spirit and effect.</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>"The princely mind, that can</p>
<p class='verse'>Teach man to keep a God in man;</p>
<p class='verse'>And when wise poets would search out to see</p>

</div></div>

<p>'Tis over thirty years since his first book was printed.
Then followed volumes of essays, poems, orations, addresses;
and during all the intervening period, down
to the present, he has read briefs of his lectures through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
a wide range, from Canada to the Capitol; in most of
the Free States; in the large cities, East and West,
before large audiences; in the smallest towns, and to
the humblest companies. Such has been his appeal to
the mind of his countrymen, such his acceptance by
them. He has read lectures in the principal cities of
England also. A poet, speaking to individuals as few
others can speak, and to persons in their privileged
moments, he is heard as none others are. The more
personal he is, the more prevailing, if not the more
popular. 'Tis everything to have a true believer in the
world, dealing with men and matters as if they were divine
in idea and real in fact; meeting persons and events at a
glance directly, not at a millionth remove, and so passing
fair and fresh into life and literature.</p>

<p>Consider how largely our letters have been enriched
by his contributions. Consider, too, the change his
views have wrought in our methods of thinking; how
he has won over the bigot, the unbeliever, at least to
tolerance and moderation, if not acknowledgment, by
his circumspection and candor of statement.</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='indent4'>"His shining armor,</p>
<p class='indent4'>A perfect charmer;</p>
<p class='indent2'>Even the hornets of divinity</p>

<p class='indent2'>And his thought has a place</p>
<p class='verse'>Upon the well-bound library's chaste shelves,</p>
<p class='verse'>Where man of various wisdom rarely delves."</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Poet and moralist, he has beauty and truth for all
men's edification and delight. His works are studies.
And any youth of free senses and fresh affections shall
be spared years of tedious toil, in which wisdom and
fair learning are, for the most part, held at arm's-length,
planets' width, from his grasp, by graduating
from this college. His books are surcharged with
vigorous thoughts, a sprightly wit. They abound in
strong sense, happy humor, keen criticisms, subtile
insights, noble morals, clothed in a chaste and manly
diction, fresh with the breath of health and progress.</p>

<p>We characterize and class him with the moralists who
surprise us with an accidental wisdom, strokes of wit,
felicities of phrase,&mdash;as Plutarch, Seneca, Epictetus,
Marcus Aurelius, Saadi, Montaigne, Bacon, Selden, Sir
Thomas Browne, Cowley, Coleridge, Goethe,&mdash;with
whose delightful essays, notwithstanding all the pleasure
they give us, we still plead our disappointment at
not having been admitted to the closer intimacy which
these loyal leaves had with their owners' mind before
torn from his note-books, jealous, even, at not having
been taken into his confidence in the editing itself.</p>

<p>We read, never as if he were the dogmatist, but a
fair-speaking mind, frankly declaring his convictions,
and committing these to our consideration, hoping we
may have thought like things ourselves; oftenest, indeed,
taking this for granted as he wrote. There is
nothing of the spirit of proselyting, but the delightful
deference ever to our free sense and right of opinion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
He might take for his motto the sentiment of Henry
More, where, speaking of himself, he says: "Exquisite
disquisition begets diffidence; diffidence in knowledge,
humility; humility, good manners and meek conversation.
For my part, I desire no man to take anything I
write or speak upon trust without canvassing, and
would be thought rather to propound than to assert what
I have here or elsewhere written or spoken. But continually
to have expressed my diffidence in the very
tractates and colloquies themselves, had been languid
and ridiculous."</p>

<p>Then he has chosen proper times and manners for
saying his good things; has spoken to almost every
great interest as it rose. Nor has he let the good
opportunities pass unheeded, or failed to make them for
himself. He has taken discretion along as his constant
attendant and ally; has shown how the gentlest temper
ever deals the surest blows. His method is that of the
sun against his rival for the cloak, and so is free from
any madness of those, who, forgetting the strength of
the solar ray, go blustering against men's prejudices, as
if the wearers would run at once against these winds of
opposition into their arms for shelter. What higher
praise can we bestow on any one than to say of him,
that he harbors another's prejudices with a hospitality
so cordial as to give him for the time the sympathy next
best to, if, indeed, it be not edification in, charity itself?
For what disturbs more, and distracts mankind, than
the uncivil manners that cleave man from man? Yet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
for whose amendment letters, love, Christianity, were
all given!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is a virtuous curiosity felt by readers of remarkable
books to learn something more of their author's
literary tastes, habits, and dispositions, than
these ordinarily furnish. Yet to gratify this is a task
as difficult as delicate, requiring a diffidency akin to
that with which one would accost the author himself,
and without which graceful armor it were impertinent
for a friend even to undertake it. We may venture but
a stroke or two here.</p>

<p>All men love the country who love mankind with a
wholesome love, and have poetry and company in them.
Our essayist makes good this preference. If city bred,
he has been for the best part of his life a villager and
countryman. Only a traveller at times professionally,
he prefers home-keeping; is a student of the landscape,
of mankind, of rugged strength wherever found;
liking plain persons, plain ways, plain clothes; prefers
earnest people; shuns egotists, publicity; likes solitude,
and knows its uses. Courting society as a
spectacle not less than a pleasure, he carries off the
spoils. Delighting in the broadest views of men and
things, he seeks all accessible displays of both for
draping his thoughts and works. And how is his page
produced? Is it imaginable that he conceives his piece
as a whole, and then sits down to execute his task at a
heat? Is not this imaginable rather, and the key to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
construction of his works? Living for composition as
few authors can, and holding company, studies, sleep,
exercise, affairs, subservient to thought, his products
are gathered as they ripen, stored in his commonplaces;
their contents transcribed at intervals, and classified.
It is the order of ideas, of imagination observed in the
arrangement, not of logical sequence. You may begin
at the last paragraph and read backwards. 'Tis Iris-built.
Each period is self-poised; there may be a
chasm of years between the opening passage and the
last written, and there is endless time in the composition.
Jewels all! Separate stars. You may have
them in a galaxy, if you like, or view them separate
and apart. But every one finds that, if he take an
essay, or verses, however the writer may have pleased
himself with the cunning workmanship, 'tis cloud-fashioned,
and a blind pathway for any one else.
Cross as you can, or not cross, it matters not, you may
climb or leap, move in circles, turn somersaults;</p>

been poured into these periods. Afternoon walks furnished
their perspectives, rounded and melodized them.

if he feared any the least intrusion of himself were an
offence offered to self-respect, the courtesy due to intercourse
and authorship; thus depriving his page, his

how to insinuate into their text and talk without overstepping
the bounds of social or literary decorum.
What is more delightful than personal magnetism?
'Tis the charm of good fellowship as of good writing.
To get and to give the largest measure of satisfaction,
to fill ourselves with the nectar of select experiences,
not without some intertinctures of egotism so charming
in a companion, is what we seek in books of the class
of his, as in their authors. We associate diffidence
properly with learning, frankness with fellowship, and
owe a certain blushing reverence to both. For though
our companion be a bashful man,&mdash;and he is the worse
if wanting this grace,&mdash;we yet wish him to be an
enthusiast behind all reserves, and capable of abandonment
sometimes in his books. I know how rare this
genial humor is, this frankness of the blood, and how
surpassing are the gifts of good spirits, especially here
in cold New England, where, for the most part,</p>

Interviews, however, bringing their trail of perplexing
thoughts, costing some days' duties, several nights'
sleep oftentimes to restore one to his place and poise
for customary employment; half a dozen annually being
full as many as the stoutest heads may well undertake

superstition concerning admirable persons, the divinity
of friendship come down from childhood, and surviving
yet in memory if not in expectation, the rumor of excellence
of any sort being like the arrival of a new gift
to mankind, and he the first to proffer his recognition
and hope. His affection for conversation, for clubs, is
a lively intimation of this religion of fellowship. He,
shall we say, if any, must have taken the census of the
admirable people of his time, perhaps numbering as
many among his friends as most living Americans,
while he is recognized as the representative mind of
his country, to whom distinguished foreigners are especially
commended on visiting us.</p>

Of Emerson's books I am not here designing to speak
critically, rather of his genius and personal influence;
yet, in passing, may remark that his "English Traits"
deserves to be honored as one in which England,
Old and New, may alike take national pride as being the
liveliest portraiture of British genius and accomplishments
there is,&mdash;a book, like Tacitus, to be quoted as
a masterpiece of historical painting, and perpetuating
the New-Englander's fame with that of his race. 'Tis
a victory of eyes over hands, a triumph of ideas. Nor
has there been for some time any criticism of a people
so characteristic and complete. It remains for him to
do like justice to New England. Not a metaphysician,
and rightly discarding any claims to systematic thinking;
the poet in spirit, if not always in form; the consistent
idealist, yet the realist none the less,&mdash;he has
illustrated the learning and thought of former times on
the noblest themes, coming nearest of any to emancipating
the mind of his own from the errors and dreams
of past ages.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Plutarch tells us that of old they were wont to call
men <span title='Greek: ph&ocirc;ta'>&phi;&#974;&tau;&alpha;</span>,
which imports light, not only for the vehement
desire man has to know, but to communicate also.
And the Platonists fancied that the gods, being above
men, had something whereof man did not partake, pure
intellect and knowledge, and they kept on their way
quietly. The beasts, being below men, had something
whereof man had less, sense and growth, so they lived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
quietly in their way. While man had something in him
whereof neither gods nor beasts had any trace, which
gave him all the trouble, and made all the confusion in
the world,&mdash;and that was egotism and opinion.</p>

<p>A finer discrimination of gifts might show that Genius
ranges through this threefold dominion, partaking
in turn of their essence and degrees.</p>

<p>Was our poet planted so fast in intellect, so firmly
rooted in the mind, so dazzled with light, yet so cleft
withal by duplicity of gifts, that fated thus to traverse
the mid-world of contrast and contrariety, he was
ever glancing forth from his coverts at life as reflected
through his dividing prism, the resident never long of
the tracts he surveyed, yet their persistent Muse nevertheless?
And so housed in the Mind, and sallying
forth from thence in quest of his game, whether of persons
or things, he was the Mercury, the merchantman
of ideas to his century. Nor was he personally
alone in his thinking. Beside him stood his townsman,
whose sylvan intelligence, fast rooted in Nature,
was yet armed with a sagacity, a subtlety and strength,
that penetrated while divining the essences of creatures
and things he studied, and of which he seemed Atlas
and Head.</p>

<p>Forcible protestants against the materialism of their
own, as of preceding times, these masterly Idealists
substantiate beyond all question their right to the
empires they sway,&mdash;the rich estates of an original
Genius.</p>

<p>A-field all summer, all winter in-doors, was the
Anglo-Saxon rule, and holds good for the Anglo-American
to-day. Englishmen still, here in New England
we borrow, at some variance with the sun's courses,
our calendar from the old country. Ordinarily our
seasons fall almost a month later, our winter hardly
opening till New-year's, nor spring till All Fools' Day,
the date of which can hardly fall amiss, and with All
Saints' may be left indefinite in wit's almanac. Doubtless
there is a closer sympathy than we suspect between
souls and seasons. Sensitive to climate within as
weather without, our intelligence dips or rises as the
signs range from Aries to Pisces in the ideal ephemeris,
measuring to faculty and member in turn the rising or
falling tides, and so determining our solar and lunar
periods.</p>

Nature is the best dictionary and school of eloquence;
genius the pupil of sun and stars, wood-lands, waters,
the fields, the spectacle of things seen under all aspects,
in all seasons and moods. Blot these from his vision,
and the scholar's page were of small account. Letters
show pale and poor from inside chambers and halls of
learning alone; and whoever will deal directly with
ideas, is often abroad to import the stuff of things into
his diction, and clothe them in a rhetoric robust and
racy, addressing the senses and mind at once. One
is surprised at finding how a little exercise, though
taken for the thousandth time, and along familiar
haunts even, refreshes and strengthens body and mind.
A turn about his grounds, a sally into the woods,
climbing the hill-top, sauntering by brook-sides, brings
him back with new senses and a new soul. One's handwriting
becomes illuminated as he turns his leaves, the
thoughts standing out distinctly, which before were
blurred, and failed to show their import. Then his
thought is sprightliest, and tells its tale firmly to the
end. It sets flowing what blood one has in his
veins, quickening wonderfully his circulations; he is
valiant, humorsome, the soul prevailing in every part,
and he takes hope of himself and the world around him.</p>

<p>An open fire, too, that best of friends to greet him
within doors for most of the months; better than councils
of friends to settle numerous questions wont to
smoulder and fret by an air-tight, or flash forth in no
lovely manner at unexpected moments. And where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
else is conversation possible? A countryman without
an open fire will consider whether he can afford to
spend himself and family to spare his wood-lot. It was
comforting to see the other day on a bookseller's counter,
tiles of porcelain, with suggestive devices of the
graceful hospitalities of the olden time, when every
mantelpiece had its attractions of fable and verse, the
conversation enhanced by the friendly blaze, around
which the family gathered and paid their devotions to
friendships, human and divine.</p>

<p>One's house should be roomy enough for his thought,

landscape and surroundings; these have their influence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
on the dispositions, the tastes, manners of the inmates,
and are not to be left out of account. Yet, without
nobility to grace them, what were the costly palace, its
parlors and parks, luxuries and elegancies, within or
without,&mdash;the handsome house owing its chief beauty
to the occupants, the company, one's virtues and accomplishments
draw inside of the mansion; persons being

<p>"It happens," says Plutarch, "that neither rich furniture,
nor moveables, nor abundance of gold, nor descent
from an illustrious family, nor greatness of authority,
nor eloquence, and all the charms of speaking, can
procure so great a serenity of life, as a mind free from
guilt and kept untainted, not only from actions but from
purposes that are wicked. By this means the soul will
be not only unpolluted, but not disturbed; the fountain
will run clear and unsullied, and the streams that flow
from it will be just and honest deeds, full of satisfaction,
a brisk energy of spirit which makes a man an
enthusiast in his joy, and a tenacious memory sweeter
than hope, which, as Pindar says, 'with a virgin
warmth cherishes old men.' For as shrubs which are
cut down with morning dew upon them, do for a long
time after retain their fragrance, so the good actions of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
a wise man perfume his mind and leave a rich scent
behind them. So that joy is, as it were, watered with
those essences, and owes its flourishing to them."</p>

<p class='footnote'><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">2.</span></a> Verstegan, in his Restitution of Decayed Intelligence, in Antiquities concerning
the most Noble and Renowned English Nation, 1634, treating of the
origin of names, says:&mdash;</p>

<p class='footnote-cont'>"For a general rule, the reader may please to note, that our surnames of
families, be they of one or more syllables, that have either a <em>k</em> or a <em>w</em>, are all
of them of the ancient English race, so that neither the <em>k</em> or <em>w</em> are used in
Latin, nor in any of the three languages thereon depending, which sometimes
causes confusion in the writing our names (originally coming from the
Teutonic) in Latin, Italian, French, and Spanish languages. Neither the
<em>k</em> nor <em>w</em> being in the Latin nor in the French, they could not be with the
Normans in use, whose language was French, as also their surnames. As
for the surnames in our Norman catalogue which have in them the letters <em>k</em>
and <em>w</em>, which the French do not use, these are not to be thought to have been
Norman, but of those gentlemen of Flanders which Baldwin, the Earl of
that country and father-in-law unto the Conquerer, did send to aid him.
Besides these, sundry other surnames do appear to have been in the Netherlands
and not in Normandy; albeit they are without doubt set in the list of
the Normans. And whereas in searching for such as may remain in England
of the race of the Danes, they are not such as, according to the vulgar
opinion, have their surnames ending in <em>son</em>. In the Netherlands, it is often
found that very many surnames end in <em>son</em>, as Johnson, Williamson,
Phillipson, and the like; <i xml:lang='la' lang='la'>i. e.</i> sons of that name of John, etc.</p>

<p class='footnote-cont'>"Then some have their surnames according to the color of hair or complexion,
as white, black, brown, gray, and reddish; and those in whom these
names from such causes begin, do thereby lose their former denomination.
Some again for their surnames have the names of beasts; and it should seem
for one thing or another wherein they represented some property of theirs;
as lion, wolf, fox, bull, buck, hare, hart, lamb, and the like. Others of
birds; as cock, peacock, swan, crane, heron, partridge, dove, sparrow, and
the like. Others of fish; as salmon, herring, rock, pilchard, and the like.
And albeit the ancestors of the bearers of these had in other times other
surnames, yet because almost all these and other like names do belong to
our English tongue, I do think him to be of the ancient English, and if not
all, yet the most part. And here by occasion of these names, I must note,
and that as it were for a general rule, <i>that what family soever has their first
and chief coat of arms correspondent unto their surname, it is evident sign
that it had that surname before it had those arms</i>."</p>

<p>Freedom from affairs, and leisure to entertain his
thoughts, is the scholar's paradise. Hardly less
the delight in comparing notes with another in conversation.
It is the chiefest of satisfactions this last,
where sympathy is possible and perfect. One does not
see his thought distinctly till it is reflected in the image
of another's. Personal perspective gives the distance
necessary to bring out its significance. "There are
some," says Thoreau, "whose ears help me so much
that my things have a rare significance when I read to
them. It is almost too good a hearing, so that, for the
time, I regard my writing from too favorable a point of
view." Yet the criticism of admiration is far more
acceptable and the more likely to be just than that of
censure. Much learning does not make an accomplished
critic; taste, sensibility, sympathy, ideality,
are indispensable. A man of talent may apprehend
and judge fairly of works of his class. But genius
alone comprehends and appreciates truly the works of
genius.</p>

<p>Nor are all moods equally favorable for criticism.
"It may be owing to my mood at the time," says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Goethe, "but it seems to me, that as well in treating
of writings as of actions, unless one speak with a loving
sympathy, a certain enthusiasm, the result is so
defective as to have little value. Pleasure, delight,
sympathy in things, is all that is real; and that reproduces
reality in us; all else is empty and vain." One
must seize the traits as they rise with the tender touch,
else they elude and dissolve in the moment; pass into
the obscurity out of which they emerged, and are
lost forever. Much depends upon this, that one
make the most of his time, and miss no propitious
moods.</p>

<p>Rarely does one win a success with either tongue or
pen. Of the books printed, scarcely never the volume
entire justifies its appearance in type. Much is void
of deep and permanent significance, touches nothing
in one's experience, and fails to command attention.
Even subjects of gravest quality, unless treated suggestively,
find no place in a permanent literature. It
is not enough that the thing is literally defined, stated
logically; it needs to be complemented ideally,&mdash;set
forth in lucid imagery to tell the story to the end. Style
carries weight oftentimes when seemingly light itself.
Movement is necessary, while the logic is unapparent,&mdash;all
the more profound and edifying as it appeals to
and speaks from the deeper instincts, and so makes
claims upon the reader's mind. That is good which
stands strong in its own strength, detached from local
relations. So a book of thoughts suggests thought,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
edifies, inspires. Whatever interests at successive
readings has life in it, and deserves type and
paper.</p>

<p>My code of composition stands thus, and this is my
advice to whom it may concern:&mdash;</p>

<p>Burn every scrap that stands not the test of all moods
of criticism. Such lack longevity. What is left gains
immensely. Such is the law. Very little of what is
thought admirable at the writing holds good over
night. Sleep on your writing; take a walk over it;
scrutinize it of a morning; review it of an afternoon;
digest it after a meal; let it sleep in your drawer a
twelvemonth; never venture a whisper about it to your
friend, if he be an author especially. You may read
selections to sensible women,&mdash;if young the better; and
if it stand these trials, you may offer it to a publisher,
and think yourself fortunate if he refuse to print it.
Then you may be sure you have written a book worthy
of type, and wait with assurance for a publisher and
reader thirty years hence,&mdash;that is, when you are engaged
in authorship that needs neither type nor publisher.</p>

<p>"Learning," says Fuller, "hath gained most by those
books by which the printers have lost." It must be an
enlightened public that asks for works the most enlightened
publishers decline printing. A magazine were
ruined already if it reflected its fears only. Yet one
cannot expect the trade to venture reputation or money
in spreading unpopular views.</p>

<p>Time is the best critic, and the better for his intolerance
of any inferiority. And fortunate for literature
that he is thus choice and exacting. Books, like character,
are works of time, and must run the gauntlet of
criticism to gain enduring celebrity. The best books
may sometimes wait for their half century, or longer,
for appreciative readers&mdash;create their readers; the few
ready to appreciate these at their issue being the most
enlightened of their time, and they diffuse the light to
their circle of readers. The torch of truth thus transmitted
sheds its light over hemispheres,&mdash;the globe at

the purest English is not always spoken or written by
graduates of universities. Speech is the fruit of breeding
and of character, and one shall find sometimes in
remote rural districts the language spoken in its simplicity
and purity, especially by sprightly boys and
girls who have not been vexed with their grammars and
school tasks. Ours is one of the richest of the spoken
tongues; it may not be the simplest in structure and
ease of attainment; yet this last may be facilitated by
simple and natural methods of studying it. Taught by
masters like Ascham or Milton, students might acquire
the art of speaking and of writing the language in its
purity and elegance, as did these great masters in their
day. Ascham lays down this sensible rule: "He that
will write well in any tongue, must follow this advice of
Aristotle: '<i>to speak as the common people do, to think as
wise men do, and so should every man understand him,
and the judgment of wise men about him</i>.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
George Chapman, the translator of Homer, thus
speaks of the scholarly pedantries of his time, of which
ours affords too many examples:&mdash;</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>"For as great clerks can use no English words,</p>
<p class='verse'>Because (alas! great clerks) English affords,</p>
<p class='verse'>Say they, no height nor copy,&mdash;a rude tongue,</p>
<p class='verse'>Since 'tis their native,&mdash;but, in Greek and Latin</p>
<p class='verse'>Their wits are rare, for thence true poesy sprung,</p>
<p class='verse'>Through which, truth knows, they have but skill to chat in,</p>
<p class='verse'>Compared with what they might have in their own."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Camden said, "that though our tongue may not be
as sacred as the Hebrew, nor as learned as the Greek,
yet it is as fluent as the Latin, as courteous as the
Spanish, as court-like as the French, and as amorous as
the Italian; so that being beautified and enriched out
of these tongues, partly by enfranchising and endenizing
foreign words, partly by implanting new ones with
artful composition, our tongue is as copious, pithy, and
significative as any in Europe."</p>

<p>If one would learn its riches at sight, let him glance
along the pages of Richardson's Dictionary; and at
the same time survey its history from Gower and
Chaucer down to our time.</p>

<p>"If there be, what I believe there is," says Dr.&nbsp;Johnson,
"in every nation, a style which never becomes
obsolete, a certain mode of phraseology so component
and congenial to the analogy and principles of its respective
language as to remain settled and unaltered;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
this style is probably to be sought in the common
intercourse of life, among those who speak only to be
understood, without ambition of eloquence. The polite
are always catching modish expressions, and the
learned depart from established forms of speech, in
hope of finding or making it better; those who wish for
distinction forsake the vulgar when the vulgar is right;
but there is a conversation above grossness and below
refinement, where propriety resides, and where Shakespeare
seems to have gathered his comic dialogues.
He is therefore more agreeable to the ears of the present
age than any other author equally remote, and
among his other excellences deserves to be studied as
one of the original masters of the language."</p>

<p class='align-right-indent'><span class="smcap">Monday, 3.</span></p>

<p>Fair spring days, the farmers beginning the planting
of the season's crops. One cannot well forego
the pleasures which the culture of a garden affords. He
must have a little spot upon which to bestow his affections,
and own his affinities with earth and sky. The
profits in a pecuniary way may be inconsiderable, but
the pleasures are rewarding. Formerly I allowed neither
hoe, spade, nor rake, not handled by myself, to
approach my plants. But when one has put his garden
within covers, to be handled in a book, he fancies he
has earned the privilege of delegating the tillage thereafter,
in part, to other hands, and may please himself
with its superintendence; especially when he is so fortunate
as to secure the services of any who can take
their orders without debate, and execute them with dispatch;
and if he care to compare opinions with them,
find they have views of their own, and respect for his.
And the more agreeable if they have a pleasant humor
and the piety of lively spirits.</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>"In laborer's ballads oft more piety</p>
<p class='verse'>God finds than in <cite>Te Deum's</cite> melody."</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
"When our ancestors," says Cato, "praised a good
man, they called him a good agriculturist and a good
husbandman; he was thought to be greatly honored who
was thus praised."</p>

<p>Without his plot of ground for tillage and ornamentation,
a countryman seems out of place, its culture and
keeping being the best occupation for keeping himself
wholesome and sweet. The garden is the tie uniting
man and nature. How civic an orchard shows in a
clearing,&mdash;a garden in a prairie, as if nature waited for
man to arrive and complete her, by converting the wild
into the human, and thus to marry beauty and utility on
the spot! A house, too, without garden or orchard, is
unfurnished, incomplete, does not fulfil our ideas of the
homestead, but stands isolate, defiant in its individualism,
with a savage, slovenly air, and distance, that lacks
softening and blending with the surrounding landscape.
Besides, it were tantalizing to note the natural advantages
of one's grounds, and at the same time be unskilful
to complete what nature has sketched for the hand
of art to adorn and idealize. With a little skill, good
taste, and small outlay of time and pains, one may
render any spot a pretty paradise of beauty and comfort,&mdash;if
these are not one in due combination, and not
for himself only, but for those who shall inherit when
he shall have left it. The rightful ownership in the
landscape is born of one's genius, partakes of his essence
thus wrought with the substance of the soil, the
structures which he erects thereon. Whoever enriches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and adorns the smallest spot, lives not in vain. For
him the poet sings, the moralist points his choicest
periods.</p>

<p>I know of nothing better suited to inspire a taste for
rural affairs than a Gardener's Almanac, containing
matters good to be known by country people. All the
more attractive the volume if tastefully illustrated, and
contain reprints of select pastoral verses, biographies,
with portraits of those who have written on country
affairs, and lists of their works. The old herbals, too,
with all their absurdities, are still tempting books, and
contain much information important for the countryman
to possess.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>Cowley and Evelyn are of rural authors the most attractive.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Cowley's Essays are delightful reading. Nor
shall I forgive his biographer for destroying the letters
of a man of whom King Charles said at his interment
in Westminster Abbey, "Mr.&nbsp;Cowley has not left a
better in England." The friend and correspondent of
the most distinguished poets, statesmen, and gentlemen
of his time, himself the first poet of his day, his letters
must have been most interesting and important, and
but for the unsettled temper of affairs, would doubtless
have been added to our polite literature.</p>

<p>Had King Charles remembered Cowley's friend Evelyn,
the compliment both to the living and dead would
have been just. Evelyn was the best of citizens and most
loyal of subjects. A complete list of his writings
shows to what excellent uses he gave himself. The
planter of forests in his time, he might be profitably consulted
as regards the replanting of New England now.</p>

<p>Respecting his planting, and the origin of his
Sylva, he writes to his friend, Lady Sunderland, August,
1690:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As to the Kalendar your ladyship mentions, whatever
assistance it may be to some novice gardener, sure
I am his lordship will find nothing in it worth his notice,
but an old inclination to an innocent diversion;
and the acceptance it found with my dear, and while he
lived, worthy friend, Mr.&nbsp;Cowley; upon whose reputation
only it has survived seven impressions, and is now
entering on the eighth, with some considerable improvement
more agreeable to the present curiosity. 'Tis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
now, Madam, almost forty years since I first writ it,
when horticulture was not much advanced in England,
and near thirty years since it was published, which consideration
will, I hope, excuse its many defects. If in
the meantime it deserve the name of no unuseful trifle,
'tis all it is capable of.</p>

<p>"When, many years ago, I came from rambling
abroad, and a great deal more since I came home
than gave me much satisfaction, and, as events
have proved, scarce worth one's pursuit, I cast about
how I should employ the time which hangs on most
young men's hands, to the best advantage; and,
when books and grave studies grew tedious, and other
impertinence would be pressing, by what innocent
diversions I might sometimes relieve myself without
compliance to recreations I took no felicity in, because
they did not contribute to any improvement of mind.
This set me upon planting of trees, and brought forth
my Sylva, which book, infinitely beyond my expectations,
is now also calling for a fourth impression, and
has been the occasion of propagating many millions of
useful timber trees throughout this nation, as I may
justify without immodesty, from many letters of acknowledgement
received from gentlemen of the first
quality, and others altogether strangers to me. His
late Majesty, Charles II, was sometimes graciously
pleased to take notice of it to me; and that I had by
that book alone incited a world of planters to repair
their broken estates and woods which the greedy rebels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
had wasted and made such havoc of. Upon encouragement,
I was once speaking to a mighty man then in despotic
power to mention the great inclination I had to
serve his majesty in a little office then newly vacant
(the salary I think hardly &pound;300), whose province was to
inspect the timber trees in his majesty's forests, etc.,
and take care of their culture and improvement; but
this was conferred upon another, who, I believe, had
seldom been out of the smoke of London, where, though
there was a great deal of timber, there were not many
trees. I confess I had an inclination to the employment
upon a public account as well as its being suitable
to my rural genius, born as I was, at Watton, among
woods.</p>

<p>"Soon after this, happened the direful conflagration
of this city, when, taking notice of our want of books of
architecture in the English tongue, I published those
most useful directions of ten of the best authors on that
subject, whose works were very rarely to be had, all
written in French, Latin, or Italian, and so not intelligible
to our mechanics. What the fruit of that labor
and cost has been, (for the sculptures, which are elegant,
were very chargeable,) the great improvement of our
workmen and several impressions of the copy since will
best testify.</p>

<p>"In this method I thought proper to begin planting
trees, because they would require time for growth, and
be advancing to delight and shade at least, and were,
therefore, by no means to be neglected and deferred,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
while buildings might be raised and finished in a summer
or two, if the owner pleased.</p>

<p>"Thus, Madam, I endeavored to do my countrymen
some little service, in as natural an order as I could for
the improving and adorning of their estates and dwellings,
and, if possible, make them in love with those
useful and innocent pleasures, in exchange for a wasteful
and ignoble sloth which I had observed so universally
corrupted an ingenious education.</p>

<p>"To these I likewise added my little history of Chalcography,
a treatise of the perfection of painting and
of libraries, medals, with some other intermesses which
might divert within doors as well as altogether without."</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p class='footnote'><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">3.</span></a> To the list of ancient authors, as Cato, Columella, Varro, Palladius,
Virgil, Theocritus, Tibullus, selections might be added from Cowley, Marlowe,
Browne, Spenser, Tusser, Dyer, Phillips, Shenstone, Cowper, Thomson,
and others less known. Evelyn's works are of great value, his Kalendarium
Hortense particularly. And for showing the state of agriculture and
of the language in his time, Tusser's Five Hundred Points of Husbandry is
full of information, while his quaint humor adds to his rugged rhymes a
primitive charm. Then of the old herbals, Gerard's is best known. He was
the father of English herbalists, and had a garden attached to his house in
Holbern. Coles published his Adam in Eden, the Paradise of Plants, in
1659; Austin his Treatise on Fruit Trees ten years earlier. Dr.&nbsp;Holland's
translation of the School of Salerne, or the Regiment of Health, appeared
in 1649. Thos.&nbsp;Tryon wrote on the virtues of plants, and on health, about the
same time, and his works are very suggestive and valuable. Miller, gardener
to the Chelsea Gardens, gave the first edition of his Gardener's Dictionary
to the press in 1731. Sir William Temple also wrote sensibly on herbs.
Cowley's Six Books of Plants was published in English in 1708. Phillips'
History of Cultivated Plants, etc., published in 1822, is a book of great
merit. So is Culpepper's Herbal.</p></div>

<p>Is it for the reason that rural life here in New England
furnishes nothing for pastoral verse, that our
poets have as yet produced so little? Yet we cannot
have had almost three centuries' residence on this side of
the Atlantic, with old England's dialect, traditions, and
customs still current in our rural districts for perspective,

not to have so adorned life and landscape with poetic
associations as to have neither honey nor dew for hiving
in sweet and tender verse, though it should fall short
of the antique or British models. Our fields and rivers,
brooks and groves, the rural occupations of country-folk,
have not been undeserving of being celebrated in
appropriate verse. Our forefathers delighted in Revolutionary
lore. We celebrate natural scenery, legends
of foreign climes, historic events, but rarely indulge in

<p class='align-right-indent'><span class="smcap">Monday, 17.</span></p>

<p>If one would learn the views of some of our most
thoughtful New-England men and women, he will
find their fullest and freshest expression in the discussions
of the Radical Club. Almost every extreme of Liberalism
is there represented, and its manners and methods
are as various as the several members who take part in
the readings and conversations. It is assumed that all
subjects proposed for discussion are open to the freest
consideration, and that each is entitled to have the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
widest scope and hospitality allowed it. Truth is
spherical, and seen differently according to the culture,
temperament, and disposition of those who survey it
from their individual standpoint. Of two or more sides,
none can be absolutely right, and conversation fails
if it find not the central truth from which all radiate.
Debate is angular, conversation circular and radiant of
the underlying unity. Who speaks deeply excludes all
possibility of controversy. His affirmation is self-sufficient:
his assumption final, absolute.</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>Yes, yes, I see it must be so,</p>
<p class='verse'>The Yes alone resolves the No.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Thus holding himself above the arena of dispute, he
gracefully settles a question by speaking so home to
the core of the matter as to undermine the premise upon
which an issue had been taken. For whoso speaks to
the Personality drives beneath the grounds of difference,
and deals face to face with principles and ideas.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>Good discourse sinks differences and seeks agreements.
It avoids argument, by finding a common
basis of agreement; and thus escapes controversy, by
rendering it superfluous. Pertinent to the platform,
debate is out of place in the parlor. Persuasion is the
better weapon in this glittering game.</p>

<p>Nothing rarer than great conversation, nothing more
difficult to prompt and guide. Like magnetism, it
obeys its own hidden laws, sympathies, antipathies, is
sensitive to the least breath of criticism. It requires
natural tact, a familiarity with these fine laws, long
experience, a temperament predisposed to fellowship,
to hold high the discourse by keeping the substance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
things distinctly in view throughout the natural windings
of the dialogue. Many can argue, not many converse.
Real humility is rare everywhere and at all
times. If women have the larger share, and venture
less in general conversation, it may be from the less
confidence, not in themselves, but in those who have
hitherto assumed the lead, even in matters more specially
concerning woman. Few men are diffident enough
to speak beautifully and well on the finest themes.</p>

<p>Conversation presupposes a common sympathy in the
subject, a great equality in the speakers; absence of
egotism, a tender criticism of what is spoken. 'Tis
this great equality and ingenuousness that renders this
game of questions so charming and entertaining, and
the more that it invites the indefinable complement of
sex. Only where the sexes are brought into sympathy,
is conversation possible. Where women are, men speak
best; for the most part, below themselves, where women
are not. And the like holds presumably of companies
composed solely of women.</p>

<p>Good discourse wins from the bashful and discreet
what they have to speak, but would not, without this
provocation. The forbidding faces are Fates to overbear
and blemish true fellowship. We give what
we are, not necessarily what we know; nothing more,
nothing less, and only to our kind, those playing best
their parts who have the nimblest wits, taking out the
egotism, the nonsense; putting wisdom, information,
in their place. Humor to dissolve, and wit to fledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
your theme, if you will rise out of commonplace; any
amount of erudition, eloquence of phrase, scope of
comprehension; figure and symbol sparingly but
fitly. Who speaks to the eye, speaks to the whole
mind.</p>

<p>Most people are too exclusively individual for conversing.
It costs too great expenditure of magnetism
to dissolve them; who cannot leave himself out of
his discourse, but embarrasses all who take part in it.
Egotists cannot converse, they talk to themselves only.</p>

<p>Conversation with plain people proves more agreeable
and profitable, usually, than with companies more
pretentious and critical. It is wont to run the deeper
and stronger without impertinent interruptions, inevitable
where cultivated egotism and self-assurance are
present with such. There remains this resource, of
ignoring civilly the interruption, and proceeding as if
the intrusion had not been interposed.</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='indent8'>"Oft when the wise</p>
<p class='verse'>Appears not wise, he works the greater good."</p>
</div></div>

<p>"Never allow yourself," said Goethe, "to be betrayed
into a dispute. Wise men fall into ignorance if they
dispute with ignorant men." Persuasion is the finest
artillery. It is the unseen guns that do execution
without smoke or tumult. If one cannot win by force
of wit, without cannonade of abuse, flourish of trumpet,
he is out of place in parlors, ventures where he can
neither forward nor grace fellowship. The great themes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
are feminine, and to be dealt with delicately. Debate
is masculine; conversation is feminine.</p>

<p>Here is a piece of excellent counsel from Plotinus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And this may everywhere be considered, that he
who pursues our form of philosophy, will, besides all
other graces, genuinely exhibit simple and venerable
manners, in conjunction with the possession of wisdom,
and will endeavor not to become insolent or proud,
but will possess confidence, accompanied with reason,
with sincerity and candor, and great circumspection."</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p class='footnote'><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">4.</span></a> "Dialectics treat of pure thought and of the method of arriving at it. A
current misapprehension on the subject of dialectics here presents itself.
Most people understand it to mean argument, and they believe that truths
may be arrived at and held by such argument placed in due logical form.
They demand the proof of an assertion, and imply something of weakness
in the reasoning power in those who fail to give this. It is well to understand
what proof means. Kant has shown us in his Critique of Pure Reason,
that the course of all such ratiocination is a movement in a circle. One
assumes in his premises what he wishes to prove, and then unfolds it as the
result. The assumptions are in all cases mere sides of antinomies or opposite
theses, each of which has validity and may be demonstrated against the
other. Thus the debater moves round and round and presupposes one-sided
premises which must be annulled before he can be in a state to perceive the
truth. Argument of this kind the accomplished dialectician never engages
in; it is simply egotism when reduced to its lowest terms. The question
assumed premises that were utterly inadmissible.</p>
<p class='footnote-cont'>"The process of true proof does not proceed in the manner of argumentation;
it does not assume its whole result in its premises, which are propositions
of reflection, and then draw them out syllogistically. Speculative
truth is never contained analytically in any one or in all of such propositions
of reflection. It is rather the negative of them, and hence is transcendent
in its entire procedure. It rises step by step, synthetically, through
the negation of the principle assumed at the beginning, until, finally, the presupposition
of all is reached. It is essentially a going from the part to the
whole. Whatever is seized by the dialectic is turned on its varied sides, and
careful note is made of its defects, <i xml:lang='la' lang='la'>i. e.</i> what it lacks within itself to make
it possible. That which it implies is added to it, as belonging to its totality,
and thus onward progress is made until the entire comprehension of its
various phases is attained. The ordinary analytic proof is seen to be shallow
after more or less experience in it. The man of insight sees that it is
a 'child's play,&mdash;a mere placing of the inevitable dogmatism a step or two
back&mdash;that is all. <i>Real speculation proceeds synthetically beyond what it
finds inadequate, until it reaches the adequate.</i>'"</p>

<p class='align-right-indent'><span class="smcap">Thursday, 20.</span></p>

<p>Horace Greeley has just issued from the
"Tribune" office a uniform edition of Margaret
Fuller's works, together with her Memoirs first published
twenty years ago. And now, while woman is the theme
of public discussion, her character and writings may be
studied to advantage. The sex has had no abler advocate.
Her book entitled "Woman in the Nineteenth
Century" anticipated most of the questions now in the
air, and the leaders in the movement for woman's welfare
might take its counsels as the text for their action.
Her methods, too, suggest the better modes of influence.
That she wrote books is the least of her merits. She
was greatest when she dropped her pen. She spoke
best what others essayed to say, and what women
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
speak best. Hers was a glancing logic that leaped
straight to the sure conclusion; a sibylline intelligence
that divined oracularly; knew by anticipation; in the
presence always, the open vision. Alas, that so much
should have been lost to us, and this at the moment
when it seemed we most needed and could profit
by it! Was it some omen of that catastrophe which
gave her voice at times the tones of a sadness almost
preternatural? What figure were she now here in times
and triumphs like ours! She seemed to have divined
the significance of woman, dared where her sex had
hesitated hitherto, was gifted to untie social knots which
the genius of a Plato even failed to disentangle.
"Either sex alone," he said, "was but half itself." Yet
he did not complement the two in honorable marriage
in his social polity. "If a house be rooted in wrong,"
says Euripides, "it will blossom in vice." As the oak is
cradled in the acorn's cup, so the state in the family.
Domestic licentiousness saps every institution, the
morals of the community at large,&mdash;a statement trite
enough, but till it is no longer needful to be made is the
commonwealth established on immovable foundations.</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>"Revere no God whom men adore by night."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Let the sexes be held to like purity of morals, and
equal justice meted to them for any infraction of the
laws of social order. Women are the natural leaders
of society in whatever concerns private morals, lead
where it were safe for men to follow. About the like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
number as of men, doubtless, possess gifts to serve the
community at large; while most women, as most men,
will remain private citizens, fulfilling private duties.
Her vote as such will tell for personal purity, for honor,
temperance, justice, mercy, peace,&mdash;the domestic virtues
upon which communities are founded, and in which
they must be firmly rooted to prosper and endure. The
unfallen souls are feminine.</p>

<p>My little grandsons visit me at this becoming season
of birds and apple blossoms. They accompany
me to the brook, and are pleased with their willow
whistles and sail-boats,&mdash;toys delightful to childhood
from the first. Their manners, that first of accomplishments,
delight us in return, showing that the sense
of beauty has dawned and their culture fairly begun.
'Tis a culture to watch them through their days' doings.
Endless their fancies and engagements. What arts,
accomplishments, graces, are woven in their playful
panorama; the scene shifting with the mood, and all in
keeping with the laws of thought and of things. Verily,
there are invisible players playing their parts through
these pretty puppets all day long.</p>

<p>To conceive a child's acquirements as originating in
nature, dating from his birth into his body, seems an
atheism that only a shallow metaphysical theology could
entertain in a time of such marvellous natural knowledge
as ours. "I shall never persuade myself," said
Synesius, "to believe my soul to be of like age with my
body." And yet we are wont to date our birth, as that
of the babes we christen, from the body's advent so
duteously inscribed in our family registers, as if time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and space could chronicle the periods of the immortal
mind, and mark its longevity by our chronometers.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
Only a God could inspire a child with the intimations
seen in its first pulse-plays; the sprightly attainments
of a single day's doings afford the liveliest proofs of an
omniscient Deity revealing his attributes in the motions
of the little one! Nor is maternity less a special inspiration
throbbing ceaselessly with childhood as a protecting
Providence, lifelong. Comes not the mother to
make the Creator's word sure that all he has made is
verily good? For without mother and wife, what more
than a rough outline of divinity were drawn? "That
man," says Euripides, "hath made his fortune who hath
married a good wife." For what would some of us
have accomplished, what should we have not done, misdone,
without her counsels to temper our adventurous
idealism? Heaven added a new power to creation when
it sent woman into it to complete what He had designed.</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>"He is a parricide to his mother's name,</p>
<p class='verse'>And with an impious hand, murthers her fame,</p>

When one becomes indifferent to women, to children
and young people, he may know that he is superannuated,
and has withdrawn from whatsoever is sweetest
and purest in human existence. One of the happiest
rewards of age is the enjoyment of children. And when
these inherit one's better gifts and graces, sinking the
worse, or omitting them altogether, what can be added
to fill the cup of parental gratitude and delight? I fail
to comprehend how the old and young folks are to enjoy
a future heaven together, unless they have learned
to partake in the enjoyments of this. Shall we picture
future separate heavens for them?</p>

<p>The family is the sensitive plant of civility, the measure
of culture. Take the census of the homes, and you
have the sum total of character and civilization in any
community. Sown in the family, the seeds of holiness
are here to be cherished and ripened for immortality.
Here is the seminary of the virtues, the graces, accomplishments,
that adorn and idealize existence. From
this college we graduate for better or for worse. This
faculty of the affections, this drinking freshly at the
springs of genius and sensibility, this intimacy with
the loveliest and best in life, is the real schooling, the
truest discipline, without which neither mind nor heart
flourish; all other advantages being of secondary account;
wealth, wit, beauty, social position, books,
travel, fellowships, are but sounding names, opportunities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of inferior importance, compared with this endowment
of personal influences.</p>

<p>Here, in this atmosphere of love and sympathy,
character thrives and ripens. And were the skill for
touching its tender sensibilities, calling forth its budding
gifts, equal to the charms the child has for us,
what noble characters would graduate from our families,&mdash;the
community receiving its members accomplished
in the Personal graces, the state its patriots, the church
its saints, all glorifying the race. One day the highest
culture of the choicest gifts will be deemed essential to
the heads of families, and the arts of nurture and of
culture honored as the art of arts.</p>

<p>"Boys are dear to divinity," dear to all mankind.
What more charming than to watch the dawning intelligence,
clearing itself from the mists which obscure its
vision of the world into which it has but lately entered?
The more attractive, since a fine sentiment then mingles
mythically with the freshness of thought, confuses the
sexes, as if the boy were being transformed into the
girl, first entering her wider world of affection; and the
girl in turn were being metamorphosed into the boy,
first becoming conscious of the newer world of intellect;
each entering, by instinct, into the mind of the other.
I know not which is the more charming each in their
ways, the coy manners of girls, or the shy behavior of
beautiful boys,&mdash;mysteries both to each other, nor less
to their elders. 'Tis the youthful sentiment, whether
feminine or masculine, that renders friendship delightful,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the world lovely; this gone, all is gone that life
can enjoy. "There are periods in one's life," says
Pythagoras, "which it is not in the power of any casual
person to connect finely, these being expelled by one
another, unless some sympathetic friend conduct him
from birth in a beautiful and upright manner."</p>

<h4>PYTHAGORAS.</h4>

<p>Of the great educators of antiquity, I esteem Pythagoras
the most eminent and successful. Everything
of his doctrine and discipline comes commended
by its elegance and humanity, and justifies the name he
bore of the golden-souled Samian, and founder of the
Greek culture. He seems to have stood in providential
nearness to the human sensibility, as if his were a maternal
relation as well, and he owned the minds whom
he nurtured and educated. The first of philosophers,
taking the name for its modesty of pretension, he
justified his claim to it in the attainments and services
of his followers; his school having given us Socrates,
Plato, Pericles, Plutarch, Plotinus, and others of almost
equal fame, founders of states and cultures.</p>

<p>He was most fortunate in his biographer. For, next
to the Gospels, I know of nothing finer of the kind
than the mythological portrait drawn of him by Jamblichus,
his admiring disciple, and a philosopher worthy
of his master. How mellow the coloring, the drapery
disposed so gracefully about the person he paints! I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
look upon this piece of nature with ever fresh delight, so
reverend, humane, so friendly in aspect and Olympian.
Nor is the interest less, but enhanced rather by the
interfusion of fable into the personal history, the charm
of a subtle idealism being thus given it, relating him
thereby to the sacred names of all times. There is in
him an Oriental splendor, as of sunrise, reflected on
statues, blooming in orchards, an ambrosial beauty and
sweetness, as of autumnal fruits and of women.</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='indent8'>"In all he did,</p>
<p class='verse'>Some picture of the golden times was hid."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Personally, he is said to have been the most beautiful
and godlike of all those who had been celebrated in
history before his time. As a youth, his aspect was
venerable and his habits strictly temperate, so that he
was reverenced and honored by elderly men. He attracted
the attention of all who saw him, and appeared
admirable in all eyes. He was adorned by piety and
discipline, by a mode of life transcendently good, by
firmness of soul, and by a body in due subjection to
the mandates of reason. In all his words and actions,
he discovered an inimitable quiet and serenity, not
being subdued at any time by anger, emulation, contention,
or any precipitation of conduct. He was reverenced
by the multitude as one under the influence of
divine inspiration. He abstained from all intoxicating
drinks, and from animal food, confining himself to a
chaste nutriment. Hence, his sleep was short and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
undisturbed, his soul vigilant and pure, his body in a
state of perfect and invariable health. He was free from
the superstitions of his time, and pervaded with a
deep sense of duty towards God, and veneration for his
divine attributes and immanency in things. He fixed
his mind so intently on the attainment of wisdom, that
systems and mysteries inaccessible to others were
opened to him by his magic genius and sincerity of
purpose. The great principle with which he started,
that of being a seeker rather than possessor of truth,
seemed ever to urge him forward with a diligence and
an activity unprecedented in the history of the past,
and perhaps unequalled since. He visited every man
who could claim any degree of fame for wisdom or
learning, whilst the relics of antiquity and the simplest
operations of nature seemed to yield to his researches;
and we moderns are using his eyes in many departments
of activity into which pure thought enters, being indebted
to him for important discoveries alike in science
and metaphysics.</p>

<p>"His institution at Crotona was the most comprehensive
and complete of any of which we read. His aim
being at once a philosophical school, a religious brotherhood,
and a political association. And all these characters
appear to have been inseparably united in the
founder's mind. It must be considered as a proof of
upright intentions in Pythagoras which ought to rescue
him from all suspicion of selfish motives, that he
chose for his associates persons whom he deemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
capable of grasping the highest truths which he could
communicate, and was not only willing to teach them
all he knew, but regarded the utmost cultivation of the
intellectual faculties as a necessary preparation for the
work to which he destined them. He instituted a
society, an order, as one may now call it, composed of
young men, three hundred in number, carefully selected
from the noblest families, not only of Crotona, but of
the other Italian cities.</p>

<p>"Those who confided themselves to the guidance of
his doctrine and discipline, conducted themselves in
the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>"They performed their morning walks alone in places
where there happened to be an appropriate solitude and
quiet, and where there were temples and groves, and
other things adapted to give delight. For they thought
it was not proper to converse with any one till they had
rendered their own soul sedate and co-harmonized with
the reasoning power. For they apprehended it to be a
thing of a turbulent nature to mingle in a crowd as soon
as they rose from bed. But after the morning walk,
they associated with each other, and employed themselves
in discussing doctrines and disciplines, and in
the correction of their manners and lives.</p>

<p>"They employed their time after dinner, which consisted
of bread and honey without wine, in domestic
labors and economies, and in the hospitalities due to
strangers and their guests, according to the laws. All
business of this sort was transacted during these hours
of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
"When it was evening, they again betook themselves
to walking, yet not singly as in the morning walk, but
in parties of two or three, calling to mind, as they
walked, the disciplines which they had learned, and
exercising themselves in beautiful studies.</p>

<p>"After bathing again, they went to supper; no more
than ten meeting together for this purpose. This meal
they finished before the setting of the sun. It was of
wine and maize, bread and salad. They were of opinion
that any animal, not naturally noxious to the human
race, should neither be injured nor slain.</p>

<p>"After supper, libations were performed; and these
were succeeded by readings, the youngest reading, and
the eldest ordering what should be read and after what
manner.</p>

<p>"They wore a white and pure garment, and slept on
beds the coverlets of which were of white linen."</p>

birth, but pass the greater part of their time in sleep; however, in their
sleep they appear both to smile and cry. But can this any otherwise happen
than through the soul agitating the circulations of their animal nature in conformity
with the passions it has experienced before birth into the body?
Besides, our looking into ourselves when we seek to discover any truth,
shows that we inwardly contain truth, though concealed in the darkness of
oblivion." Does atom animate and revive thought, or thought animate and

<h3><a name="CONVERSATION_WITH_CHILDREN" id="CONVERSATION_WITH_CHILDREN">CONVERSATION WITH CHILDREN.</a></h3>

<p class='align-right-indent'><span class="smcap">Monday, 24.</span></p>

<p>My book of Conversations, held with Children in
Boston near forty years ago, has found an admiring
reader at last. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have just found in a second-hand bookstore your
two volumes of Conversations on the Gospels, and have
read them with benefit and delight. Nowhere have I
seen the Gospels so spiritualized, so rationalized,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Platonized. The <i xml:lang='fr' lang='fr'>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> aside, it seems the product
of a company of idealists. Is it possible that common
human nature in children, thrown upon its own resources,
can exhibit such intelligence, or instinct, if
you please to call it so? Were these children taken as
they came, or were they selected, culled?"</p>

<p>They came from families occupying various social
advantages, and were a fair average of children thus
born and bred. I give a sample of one of the conversations
as reported from their lips at the time. Their
ages were from six to twelve years.</p>

<h4>CONVERSATION ON WORSHIP.</h4>

<p>Mr.&nbsp;Alcott read (having previously read the beginning)
the remainder of the Conversation of Jesus with
the woman of Samaria (John iv. 16&ndash;30),&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>16. Jesus saith unto her, Go call thy husband, and come
hither.</p>

<p>17. The woman answered and said, I have no husband.
Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said I have no husband:</p>

<p>18. For thou hast had five husbands, and he whom thou
now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.</p>

<p>19. The woman said unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art
a prophet.</p>

<p>20. Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say
that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</p>

<p>21. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour
cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at
Jerusalem, worship the Father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>22. Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship,
for salvation is of the Jews.</p>

<p>23. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers
shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for
the father seeketh such to worship him.</p>

<p>24. God <em>is</em> a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship
<em>him</em> in spirit and in truth.</p>

<p>25. The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh,
which is called Christ; when he is come, he will tell us all
things.</p>

<p>26. Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am <em>he</em>.</p>

<p>27. And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that
he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest
thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?</p>

<p>28. The woman then left her water-pot, and went her way
into the city, and saith to the men,</p>

<p>29. Come, see a man which told me all things that ever I
did: is not this the Christ?</p>

<p>30. Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</p></blockquote>

<p class='p1'>Before he had time to ask the usual question,&mdash;</p>

<p class='p05'><span class="smcap">Samuel T.</span> (<em>spoke</em>). I was most interested in this
verse: "He that drinks of this water shall thirst again,
but he that drinks of the water that I shall give him,
shall never thirst." He means by this, that those who
heard what he taught, and did it, should live always,
should never die, their spirits should never die.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Can spirits die?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samuel T.</span> For a spirit to die is to leave off being
good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward J.</span> I was interested in the words, "For
the water I shall give him will be in him a well of
water." I think it means that when people are good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and getting better, it is like water springing up always.
They have more and more goodness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samuel R.</span> Water is an emblem of holiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Water means spirit, pure and unsoiled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward J.</span> It is holy spirit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellen.</span> I was most interested in these words: "Ye
worship ye know not what." The Samaritans worship
idols, and there was no meaning to that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> What do you mean by their worshipping
idols?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellen.</span> They cared about things more than God.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> What kind of false worship do you
think Jesus was thinking about when he said: "Woman,
the hour is coming and now is, when neither in this
mountain&mdash;"?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellen.</span> Oh! she thought the place of worship was
more important than the worship itself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Well! how did Jesus answer that
thought?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellen.</span> He told her what she ought to worship,
which was more important than where.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Some of you, perhaps, have made
this mistake, and thought that we only worshipped God
in churches, and on Sundays. How is it,&mdash;who has
thought so?</p>

<p>(<span class='stage-directions'>Several held up hands, smiling.</span>)</p>

<p>Who knew that we could worship God anywhere?</p>

<p>(<span class='stage-directions'>Others held up hands.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>What other worship is there besides that in the
church?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward J.</span> The worship in our hearts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> How is that carried on?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward J.</span> By being good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nathan.</span> We worship God by growing better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Augustine.</span> We worship God when we repent of
doing wrong.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> I was most interested in this verse: "God
is a spirit, and they that worship him must worship him
in spirit and in truth." It means that to feel our
prayers is more important than to say the words.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lemuel.</span> And when we pray and pray sincerely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> What is praying sincerely?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lemuel.</span> Praying the truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> What is to be done in praying the
truth? When you think of prayer, do you think of a
position of the body&mdash;of words?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lemuel</span> (<span class='stage-directions'>earnestly</span>). I think of something else, but
I cannot express it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Josiah is holding up his hand; can
he express it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah</span> (<span class='stage-directions'>burst out</span>). To pray, Mr.&nbsp;Alcott, is to be
good, really; you know it is better to be bad before
people and to be good to God alone, because then we
are good for goodness sake, and not to be seen, and not
for people's sake. Well, so it is about prayer. There
must be nothing outward with prayer; but we must
have some words, sometimes; sometimes we need not.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
If we don't feel the prayer, it is worse than never to
say a word of prayer. It is wrong not to pray, but it
is more wrong to speak prayer and not pray. We had
better do nothing about it, Mr.&nbsp;Alcott! we must say
words in a prayer, and we must feel the words we say,
and we must do what belongs to the words.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Oh! there must be doing, must there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> Oh! yes, Mr.&nbsp;Alcott! doing is the most
important part. We must ask God for help, and at the
same time try to do the thing we are to be helped about.
If a boy should be good all day, and have no temptation,
it would not be very much; there would be no
improvement; but if he had temptation, he could pray
and feel the prayer, and try to overcome it, and would
overcome it; and then there would be a real prayer
and a real improvement. That would be something.
Temptation is always necessary to a real prayer, I think.
I don't believe there is ever any real prayer before
there is a temptation; because we may think and feel
and say our prayer; but there cannot be any doing,
without there is something to be done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Well, Josiah, that will do now. Shall
some one else speak?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> Oh, Mr.&nbsp;Alcott, I have not half done!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward J.</span> Mr.&nbsp;Alcott, what is the use of responding
in church?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Cannot you tell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward J.</span> No; I never knew.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> Oh! Mr.&nbsp;Alcott!</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Well, Josiah, do you know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> Why, Edward! is it not just like a mother's
telling her child the words? The child wants to pray;
it don't know how to express its real thoughts, as we
often say to Mr.&nbsp;Alcott here; and the mother says
words, and the child repeats after her the words.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward J.</span> Yes; but I don't see what good it does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> What! if the mother says the words, and
the child repeats them and feels them,&mdash;really wants
the things that are prayed for,&mdash;can't you see that it
does some good?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward J.</span> It teaches the word-prayer&mdash;it is not
the real prayer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> Yet it must be the real prayer, and the real
prayer must have some words.</p>

<p>But, Mr.&nbsp;Alcott, I think it would be a great deal
better, if, at church, everybody prayed for themselves.
I don't see why one person should pray for all the rest.
Why could not the minister pray for himself, and the
people pray for themselves? and why should not all
communicate their thoughts? Why should only one
speak? Why should not all be preachers? Everybody
could say something; at least, everybody could say
their own prayers, for they know what they want.
Every person knows the temptations they have, and
people are tempted to do different things. Mr.&nbsp;Alcott,
I think Sunday ought to come oftener.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Our hearts can make all time Sunday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> Why, then, nothing could be done! There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
must be week-days, I know&mdash;some week-days; I said,
Sunday oftener.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> But you wanted the prayers to be
doing prayers. Now some of the rest may tell me,
how you could pray doing prayers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George K.</span> Place is of no consequence. I think
prayer is in our hearts. Christian prayed in the cave
of Giant Despair. We can pray anywhere, because we
can have faith anywhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Faith, then, is necessary?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George K.</span> Yes; for it is faith that makes the
prayer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Suppose an instance of prayer in
yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George K.</span> I can pray going to bed or getting up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> You are thinking of time, place, words.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George K.</span> And feelings and thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> And action?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George K.</span> Yes; action comes after.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John B.</span> When we have been doing wrong and are
sorry, we pray to God to take away the evil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> What evil, the punishment?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John B.</span> No; we want the forgiveness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> What is for-give-ness? Is it anything
given?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lemuel.</span> Goodness, holiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John B.</span> And the evil is taken away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Is there any action in all this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John B.</span> Why, yes; there is thought and feeling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> But it takes the body also to act;
what do the hands do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John B.</span> There is no prayer in the hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> You have taken something that belongs
to another; you pray to be forgiven; you wish
not to do so again; you are sorry. Is there anything
to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John B.</span> If you injure anybody, and can repair it,
you must, and you will, if you have prayed sincerely;
but that is not the prayer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Would the prayer be complete without
it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John B.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> Prayer is in the spirit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Does the body help the spirit?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> It don't help the prayer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Don't the lips move?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> But have the lips anything to do with
the prayer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Yes; they may. The whole nature
may act together; the body pray; and I want you to
tell an instance of a prayer in which are thoughts, feelings,
action; which involves the whole nature, body
and all. There may be prayer in the palms of our hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew.</span> Why, if I had hurt anybody, and was
sorry and prayed to be forgiven, I suppose I should
look round for some medicine and try to make it well.</p>

<p>(<i>Mr.&nbsp;Alcott here spoke of the connection of the mind
with the body, in order to make his meaning clearer.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span><span class="smcap">Samuel R.</span> If I had a bad habit, and should ask
God for help to break it; and then should try so as
really to break it, that would be a prayer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Suppose I saw a poor beggar boy hurt or
sick, and all bleeding; and I had very nice clothes, and
was afraid to soil them, or from any such cause should
pass him by, and by and by I should look back and
see another boy helping him, and should be really sorry
and pray to be forgiven, that would be a real prayer;
but if I had done the kindness at the time of it, that
would have been a deeper prayer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Augustine.</span> When anybody has done wrong, and
does not repent for a good while, but at last repents
and prays to be forgiven, it may be too late to do anything
about it; yet that might be a real prayer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Imagine a real doing prayer in your
life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucia.</span> Suppose, as I was going home from school,
some friend of mine should get angry with me, and
throw a stone at me; I could pray not to be tempted to
do the same, to throw a stone at her, and would not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> And would the not doing anything in
that case be a prayer and an action? Keeping your
body still would be the body's part of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucia.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellen.</span> I heard a woman say, once, that she could
pray best when she was at work; that when she was
scouring the floor she would ask God to cleanse her
mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> I will now vary my question. Is there
any prayer in Patience?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All.</span> A great deal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> In Impatience?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All.</span> No; not any.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> In Doubt?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George K.</span> No; but in Faith.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> In Laziness?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> (<span class='stage-directions'>but Josiah</span>). No; no kind of prayer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> I should think that Laziness was the prayer
of the body, Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Yes; it seems so. The body tries to
be still more body; it tries to get down into the clay;
it tries to sink; but the spirit is always trying to lift it
up and make it do something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward J.</span> Lazy people sometimes have passions
that make them act.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Yes; they act downwards. Is there
any prayer in Disobedience?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Is there any in submission? In forbearing
when injured? In suffering for a good object?
In self-sacrifice?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> (<span class='stage-directions'>eagerly to each question</span>). Yes. Yes. Yes.
Yes.</p>

<p>(<i>Mr.&nbsp;Alcott here made some very interesting remarks
on loving God with all our heart, soul, mind, etc., and
the Idea of Devotion it expressed. Josiah wanted to
speak constantly, but Mr.&nbsp;Alcott checked him, that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
others might have opportunity, though the latter wished
to yield to Josiah.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah</span> (<span class='stage-directions'>burst out</span>). Mr.&nbsp;Alcott! you know Mrs.
Barbauld says in her hymns, everything is prayer;
every action is prayer; all nature prays; the bird
prays in singing; the tree prays in growing; men pray;
men can pray more; we feel; we have more&mdash;more
than nature; we can know and do right; Conscience
prays; all our powers pray; action prays. Once we
said here, that there was a "Christ in the bottom of
our spirits" when we try to be good; then we pray in
Christ; and that is the whole.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Yes, Josiah, that is the whole. That
is Universal Prayer&mdash;the adoration of the Universe to
its Author!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> I was most interested in this verse&mdash;"The
day is coming, and now is, when men shall worship
the Father," etc. I think that this means that
people are about to learn what to worship, and where.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Have you learned this to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Yes; I have learnt some new things, I
believe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> What are you to worship?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Goodness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Where is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Within.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Within what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Conscience, or God.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Are you to worship Conscience?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Is it anywhere but in yourself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Yes; it is in Nature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Is it in other people?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Yes; there is more or less of it in other
people, unless they have taken it out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Can it be entirely taken out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Goodness always lingers in Conscience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Is Conscience anywhere but in Human
Nature?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> It is in the Supernatural.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> You said at first that there was something
in outward Nature which we should worship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> No; I don't think we should worship anything
but the Invisible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> What is the Invisible?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> It is the Supernatural.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John B.</span> It is the Inward&mdash;the Spiritual. But I
don't see why we should not worship the sun a little as
well&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> As well as the Sun-maker? But there
are sun-worshippers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John B.</span> Yes; a little; for the sun gives us light
and heat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> What is the difference between your
feeling when you think of the sun, or the ocean (<i>he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
described some grand scenes</i>), and when you think of
Conscience acting in such cases as&mdash;(<i>he gave some
striking instances of moral power</i>). Is there not a
difference?</p>

<p>(<span class='stage-directions'>They raised their hands.</span>)</p>

<p>What is the name of the feeling with which you look
at Nature?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Several.</span> Admiration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> But when Conscience governs our
weak body, is it not a Supernatural Force? Do you
not feel the awe of the inferior before a superior nature?
And is not that worship? The sun cannot produce it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> Spirit worships Spirit. Clay worships Clay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Wait a moment, Josiah. I wish first
to talk with the others; let me ask them this question:
Do you feel that Conscience is stronger than the
mountain, deeper and more powerful than the ocean?
Can you say to yourself, I can remove this mountain?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah</span> (<span class='stage-directions'>burst out</span>). Yes, Mr.&nbsp;Alcott! I do not
mean that with my body I can lift up a mountain&mdash;with
my hand; but I can feel; and I know that my
Conscience is greater than the mountain, for it can feel
and do; and the mountain cannot. There is the
mountain, there! It was made, and that is all. But
my Conscience can grow. It is the same kind of Spirit
as made the mountain be, in the first place. I do not
know what it may be and do. The Body is a mountain,
and the Spirit says, be moved, and it is moved into
another place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>Mr.&nbsp;Alcott, we think too much about clay. We
should think of Spirit. I think we should love Spirit,
not Clay. I should think a mother now would love her
baby's Spirit; and suppose it should die, that is only
the Spirit bursting away out of the Body. It is alive;
it is perfectly happy. I really do not know why people
mourn when their friends die. I should think it would
be matter of rejoicing. For instance: now, if we
should go out into the street and find a box&mdash;an old
dusty box&mdash;and should put into it some very fine
pearls, and by and by the box should grow old and
break, why, we should not even think about the box;
but if the pearls were safe, we should think of them
and nothing else. So it is with the Soul and Body. I
cannot see why people mourn for bodies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Yes, Josiah; that is all true, and we
are glad to hear it. Shall some one else now speak
besides you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> Oh, Mr.&nbsp;Alcott! then I will stay in the recess
and talk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> When a little infant opens its eyes
upon this world, and sees things out of itself, and has
the feeling of admiration, is there in that feeling the
beginning to worship?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> No, Mr.&nbsp;Alcott; a little baby does not
worship. It opens its eyes on the outward world, and
sees things, and perhaps wonders what they are; but
it don't know anything about them or itself. It don't
know the uses of anything; there is no worship in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> But in this feeling of wonder and
admiration which it has, is there not the beginning of
worship that will at last find its object?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> No; there is not even the beginning of
worship. It must have some temptation, I think, before
it can know the thing to worship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> But is there not a feeling that comes
up from within, to answer to the things that come to the
eyes and ears?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> But feeling is not worship, Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Can there be worship without feeling?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> No; but there can be feeling without worship.
For instance, if I prick my hand with a pin, I
feel, to be sure, but I do not worship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> That is bodily feeling. But may not
the little infant find its power to worship in the feeling
which is first only admiration of what is without.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah.</span> No, no; I know what surprise is, and I
know what admiration is; and perhaps the little
creature feels that. But she does not know enough to
know that she has conscience, or that there is temptation.
My little sister feels, and she knows some
things; but she does not worship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.&nbsp;Alcott.</span> Now I wish you all to think. What
have we been talking about to-day?</p>

<h3><a name="PLUTARCHS_LETTER_TO_HIS_WIFE" id="PLUTARCHS_LETTER_TO_HIS_WIFE">PLUTARCH'S LETTER TO HIS WIFE.</a></h3>

<p class='align-right-indent'><span class="smcap">Sunday, 30.</span></p>

<p>I sometimes think the funeral rites and cemeteries
of a people best characterize its piety. Contrast
the modern with the primitive grave-yards,&mdash;their
funeral services so dismal, doleful, despairing: as if
their faith in immortality were fittest clad in sables,
and death were a descent of souls, instead of an
ascension. What fairer views of life and of immortality
our fresher faith exhibits. Verdure, cheerful marbles,
tasteful avenues, flowers, simple epitaphs, inscriptions
celebrating the virtues properly humane. What
in the range of English lyric verse is comparable to
Wordsworth's ode, entitled Intimations of Immortality
in Childhood, or his prose Essay on Epitaphs. Nor is
the contrast so disparaging between these and Pagan
moralities. Christianity can hardly add to the sweetness
and light, the tenderness, trust in man's future
well-being, shown in Plutarch's consolatory Letter to
his Wife on the death of his little daughter. One
becomes more Christian, even, in copying it.</p>

<h4>PLUTARCH TO HIS WIFE&mdash;ALL HEALTH.</h4>

<p>"As for the messenger you dispatched to tell me of
the death of my little daughter, it seems he missed his
way as he was going to Athens. But when I came to
Tanagra I heard of it by my niece. I suppose by this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
time the funeral is over. I wish that whatever happens,
as well now as hereafter, may create you no dissatisfaction.
But if you have designedly let anything alone,
depending upon my judgment, thinking better to determine
the point if I were with you, I pray let it be
without ceremony or timorous superstition, which I
know are far from you. Only, dear wife, let you and
me bear our affliction with patience. I know very well,
and do comprehend what loss we have had; but if I
should find you grieve beyond measure, this would
trouble me more than the thing itself; for I had my
birth neither from a stock nor stone, and you know it
full well; I having been assistant to you in the education
of so many children, which we brought up at home
under our own care.</p>

<p>"This much-lamented daughter was born after four
sons, which made me call her by your own name;
therefore, I know she was dear to you, and grief must
have a peculiar pungency in a mind tenderly affectionate
to children, when you call to mind how naturally
witty and innocent she was, void of anger, and not
querulous. She was naturally mild and compassionate,
to a miracle. And she showed delight in, and gave a
specimen of, her humanity and gratitude towards anything
that had obliged her, for she would pray her nurse
to give suck, not only to other children, but to her very
playthings, as it were courteously inviting them to her
table, and making the best cheer for them she could.
Now, my dear wife, I see no reason why these and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
like things which delighted us so much when she was
alive, should, upon remembrance of them, afflict us
when she is dead. But I also fear, lest while we cease
from sorrowing, we should forget her, as Clymene
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>I hate the handy horned bow,</p>
<p class='verse'>And banish youthful pastimes now,</p>
</div></div>

<p class='no-indent'>
because she would not be put in mind of her son, by
the exercises he had been used to. For nature always
shuns such things as are troublesome. But since our
little daughter afforded all our senses the sweetest and
most charming pleasure, so ought we to cherish her
memory, which will in many ways conduce more to our
joy than grief. And it is but just that the same arguments
which we have ofttimes used to others should
prevail upon ourselves at this so seasonable a time, and
that we should not supinely sit down and overwhelm
the joys which we have tasted with a multiplicity of
new griefs. Moreover, they who were present at the
funeral, report this with admiration, that you neither
put on mourning, nor disguised yourself, or any of your
maids; neither were there any costly preparations, nor
magnificent pomp, but that all things were managed
with prudence and moderation. And it seemed not
strange to me, that you, who never used richly to dress
yourself, for the theatre or other public solemnities,
esteeming such magnificence vain and useless, even in
matters of delight, have now practised frugality on
this finest occasion.&hellip; There is no philosopher of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
your acquaintance who is not in love with your frugality,
both in apparel and diet; nor a citizen, to
whom the simplicity and plainness of your dress is
not conspicuous, both at religious sacrifices and public
shows in the theatre. Formerly, also, you discovered
on a like occasion, a great constancy of mind when
you lost your eldest son. And again, when the lovely
Charon left us. For I remember when the news was
brought me of my son's death, as I was returning home
with some friends and guests who accompanied me to
my house, that when they beheld all things in order,
and observed a profound silence everywhere (as they
afterwards declared to others), they thought no such
calamity had happened, but that the report was false.
So discreetly had you settled the affairs of the house at
that time, when no small confusion and disorder might
have been expected. And yet you gave this son suck
yourself, and endured the lancing of your breast to
prevent the ill effects of a contusion. These are things
worthy of a generous woman, and one that loves her
children.&hellip;</p>

<p>"Moreover, I would have you endeavor to call often
to mind that time when our daughter was not as yet
born to us, then we had no cause to complain of fortune.
Then, joining that time with this, argue thus
with yourself, that we are in the same condition as
then. Otherwise, dear wife, we shall seem discontented
at the birth of our little daughter if we own that our
circumstances were better before her birth. But the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
two years of her life are by no means to be forgotten
by us, but to be numbered amongst our blessings, in
that they afforded us an agreeable pleasure. Nor must
we esteem a small good for a great evil, nor ungratefully
complain of fortune for what she has actually
given us, because she has not added what we wished
for. Certainly, to speak reverently of the gods, and to
bear our lot with an even mind, without accusing fortune,
always brings with it a fair reward.&hellip;</p>

<p>"But if you lament the poor girl because she died
unmarried and without offspring, you have wherewithal
to comfort yourself, in that you are defective in none
of these things, having had your share. And those are
not small benefits where they are enjoyed. But so long
as she is gone to a place where she feels no pain, she
has no need of our grief. For what harm can befall us
from her when she is free from all hurt? And surely,
the loss of great things abates its grief when it is come
to this, that there is no more ground of grief, or care
for them. But thy Timoxena was deprived but of small
matters, for she had no knowledge but of such, neither
took she delight but in such small things. But for that
which she never was sensible of, nor so much as once
did enter her thoughts, how can you say it is taken
from you?</p>

<p>"As for what you hear others say, who persuade the
vulgar that the soul when once freed from the body,
suffers no inconvenience or evil, nor is sensible at all,
I know that you are better grounded in the doctrines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
delivered down to us from our ancestors, as also in
the sacred mysteries of Bacchus, than to believe such
stories, for the religious symbols are well known to us
who are of the fraternity. Therefore, be assured that
the soul, being incapable of death, suffers in the same
manner as birds that are kept in a cage. For if she
has been a long time educated and cherished in the
body, and by long custom has been made familiar with
most things of this life, she will (though separable)
return to it again, and at length enters the body; nor
ceases it by new birth now and then to be entangled in
the chances and events of this life. For do not think
that old age is therefore evil spoken of and blamed, because
it is accompanied with wrinkles, gray hairs, and
weakness of body; but this is the most troublesome
thing in old age, that it stains and corrupts the soul
with the remembrances of things relating to the body,
to which she was too much addicted; thus it bends
and loves, retaining that form which it took of the
body. But that which is taken away in youth, being
more soft and tractable, soon returns to its native
vigor and beauty, just like fire that is quenched,
which, if it be forthwith kindled again, sparkles and
burns out immediately.</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>As soon as e'er we take one breath</p>
<p class='verse'>'T were good to pass the gates of death,</p>
</div></div>

<p class='no-indent'>before too great love of bodily and earthly things be
engendered in the soul, and it become soft and tender
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
by being used to the body, and, as it were, by charms
and portions incorporated with it. But the truth of
this will appear in the laws and traditions, received
from our ancestors; for when children die, no libations
nor sacrifices are made for them, nor any other of those
ceremonies which are wont to be performed for the
dead. For infants have no part of earth or earthly
affections, nor do they hover or tarry about their sepulchres
or monuments, where their dead bodies are exposed.
The religion of our country teaches us otherwise,
and it is an impious thing not to believe what our laws
and traditions assert, that the souls of infants pass
immediately into a better and more divine state; therefore,
since it is safer to give credit to our traditions
than to call them in question, let us comply with the
custom in outward and public behavior, and let our
interior be more unpolluted, pure and holy."</p>

The sleep you get before midnight
goes to virtue; after sunrise, to vice. "It is wise,"
says Aristotle, "to be up before daybreak, for such

<p>The strawberry, it appears, was not restored to
gardens till within a century or two back. Evelyn
mentions "planting them out of the woods." I do not
find it mentioned as a cultivated plant in the Greek
or Roman rural authors. Phillips, in his History of
Fruits, gives this pleasant account of the origin of its
name. That of "an ancient practice of children threading
the wild berries upon straws of grass," somewhat
as rude country boys thread birds' egg-shells like
beads, as ornaments for their mirrors. He says that
this is still a custom in parts of England where they
abound, and that so many "straws of berries" are sold
for a penny,&mdash;a more picturesque style of marketing
than in pottles, or boxes. Evelyn mentions the kinds
common in his time: Common Wood, English, American,
or Virginia, Polona, White, Ivy Red, the Green,
and Scarlet.</p>

<p>Culpepper, in his British Herbal, says: "This plant
is so well known that it needs no description. It
grows in woods and is planted in gardens. It flowers
in May; the fruit ripens soon after. Venus owns the
herb. The fruit, when green, is cool and dry; but
when ripe, cool and moist." He gives a list of its medical
virtues, among which, he says, "the water of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
berries, carefully distilled, is a remedy and cordial in
the panting and beating of the heart." It were almost
worth having this trouble to be cured by his strawberry
cordials.</p>

<p>He describes the raspberry, also called thimbleberry,
and ascribes to it similar medical virtues.</p>

<p>Of bilberries, he says there are two sorts common
in England,&mdash;the black and red. The red bilberry he
calls "whortleberry," and says: "The black groweth
in forests, on the heath, and such like barren places.
The red grows in the north parts of this land, as Lancashire,
Yorkshire, etc., flowers in March and April,
the fruit ripening in July and August." "Both are
under the dominion of Jupiter," and, if we may believe
him, are very virtuous, it being "a pity they are used
no more in physic than they are." In August we gather
as good in</p>

<h3><a name="LETTERS" id="LETTERS">LETTERS.</a></h3>

<p class='align-right-indent'><span class="smcap">Thursday, 3.</span></p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>"Love is the life of friendship; letters are</p>
<p class='verse'>The life of love, the loadstones that by rare</p>
<p class='verse'>Attractions make souls meet and melt, and mix,</p>
<p class='verse'>As when by fire exalted gold we fix."</p>
</div></div>

<p>But for letters the best of our life would hardly
survive the mood and the moment. Prompted by
so lively a sentiment as friendship, we commit to our
leaves what we should not have spoken. To begin
with "Dear Friend" is in itself an address which
clothes our epistle in a rhetoric the most select and
choice. We cannot write it without considering its
fitness and taxing our conscience in the matter. 'Tis
coming to the confessional, leaving nothing in reserve
that falls gracefully into words. A life-long correspondence
were a biography of the correspondents.
Preserve your letters till time define their value. Some
secret charm forbids committing them to the flames;
the dews of the morning may sparkle there still, and
remind one of his earlier Eden.</p>

<p>"Deeds are masculine, words feminine; letters are
neither," wrote Howel. Rather say, letters are both,
and better represent life than any form in literature.
Women have added the better part, the most celebrated
letters having been written by women. If
your morning's letter is not answered and dispatched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
forthwith, 'tis doubtful if it will ever be written. Then
there are those to whom one never writes, much as he
may wish to cultivate correspondence. He reserves
them for personal intercourse.</p>

<p>I hardly know which I most enjoy, the letter I send
after my visitor, or the visit itself: the presence, the
conversation, the recollection. Memory idealizes anticipation;
our visit is made before we make it, made
afterwards, as if love were a reminiscence of pleasures
once partaken in overflowing fulness. The visit that is
not all we anticipated is not made; we meet as idealists,
if we meet at all.</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>My moments are not mine, thou art in sight</p>
<p class='verse'>By days' engagements and the dreams of night,</p>
<p class='verse'>Nor dost one instant leave me free</p>
<p class='verse'>Forgetful of thy world and thee.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The popular superstition favors long visits. I confess
my experience has not borne out the current creed.
Compliment, of course, is of the other opinion, if we
must take her fine accents of "stay, stay longer." But
a week's stay with an angel would hardly bear the
epithet angelic after it was over. Fewer and farther
between. Good things are good to keep long by temperate
use. 'Tis true a visitor who comes seldom should
not fly away forthwith. And 'tis a comfort in these
fast times to catch one who has a little leisure on hand,
deaf the while to the engine's whistle. <em>Stay</em> is a charming
word in a friend's vocabulary. But if one does
not stay while staying, better let him go where he is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
gone the while. One enjoys a visitor who has much
leisure in him, in her especially,&mdash;likes to take his
friends by sips sweetly, not at hasty draughts, as they
were froth and would effervesce forthwith and subside.
Who has not come from an interview as from a marriage
feast, feeling "the good wine had been kept for him
till <em>now</em>"?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Does it imply a refinement in delicacy that nuptial
verses have no place with us in marriage ceremonies;
that the service has lost the mystic associations wont
to be thrown around it by our ancestors down almost to
our time? Once epithalamium verses were esteemed
the fairest flowers, the ornament of the occasion. If
the poet sometimes overstepped modern notions of
reserve, the sentiments expressed were not the less
natural if more freely dealt with. Spenser, for instance,
suggests the loveliest images, and with all his
wealth of fancy ventures never a glimpse that a bride
can blame; while Donne delights in every posture of
fancy, as if he were love's attorney putting in his plea
for all delights,&mdash;yet delicately, oftentimes, and on
other occasions, as in these lines entitled "Love
Tokens":&mdash;</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>"Send me some token that my hope may live,</p>
<p class='indent'>Or that my ceaseless thoughts may sleep and rest;</p>
<p class='verse'>Send me some honey to make sweet my hive,</p>
<p class='indent'>That in my passions I may hope the best.</p>
<p class='verse'><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>I beg no ribbon wrought with thine own hands</p>
<p class='indent'>To knit our loves in the fantastic strain</p>
<p class='verse'>Of new-touched youth; nor ring to show the stands</p>
<p class='indent'>Of our affection:&mdash;that as that's round and plain,</p>
<p class='verse'>So should our loves meet in simplicity,&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent'>No, nor the corals which thy wrist infold</p>
<p class='verse'>Laced up together in congruity</p>
<p class='indent'>To show our thoughts should rest in the same hold:</p>
<p class='verse'>No, nor thy picture, though most gracious,</p>
<p class='indent'>And most desired since 'tis like the best,</p>
<p class='verse'>Nor witty lines which are most copious</p>
<p class='indent'>Within the writings which thou hast addressed:</p>
<p class='verse'>Send me not this, nor that, to increase my store,</p>
<p class='verse'>But swear thou think'st I love thee, and no more."</p>
</div></div>

<p>To the Lady Goodyeare he writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class='p05'>"<span class="smcap">Madam</span>:&mdash;I am not come out of England if I remain in
the noblest part of it, your mind. Yet I confess it is too much
diminution to call your mind any part of England, or this
world, since every part of even your body deserves titles to
a higher dignity. No Prince would be loath to die that were
assured of so fair a tomb to preserve his memory. But I have
a greater advantage than this, for since there is a religion in
friendship, and death in absence, to make up an entire friend
there must needs be a heaven too; and there can be no heaven
so proportional to that religion and that death, as your favor.
And I am the gladder that it is a heaven, than it were a court,
or any other high place of this world, because I am likelier
to have a room there, and better, cheap. Madam, my best
treasure is time, and my best employment of that (next my
thoughts of thankfulness to my Redeemer) is to study good
wishes for you, in which I am, by continual meditation, so
learned that any creature except your own good angel, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
it does you most good, might be content to come and take
instruction from</p>

<p class='center'>Your humble and affectionate servant,</p>
<p class='align-right-indent'>J. D.</p>
<p>Amyens, the 7th of February, year 1611."</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='p1'>What delicacy of compliment, coupled with nobility
of sentiment, the fresh color of flattery not less, the
rhetoric so graceful. One asks if our New-England
reserve has added any graces to the Elizabethan courtliness,
and if any feel quite at home in its tight costumes.
Is it a want of taste if one is taken with such
courtly compliments, lofty appreciation of character,
such stately idealism, extravagant as it may appear,
and bordering on insincerity? I wish my behavior, my
letters, my address, may blush becomingly, court my
friends' eyes as well as affections, by coy diffidences,
win by lively phrase, telling how lovely presence is.
Friendship is a plant that loves the sun,&mdash;thrives ill
under clouds. I know temperaments have their zones,
and can excuse the frigid manner of some in whose
breasts there burns a hidden flame. There is a reserve
that seems to fear the affections will be frosted by exposure,
if not protected from any wind of acknowledgment.
If "your humble servant" is written seldomer
at the end of the letter, and "Sir" and "Madam" have
dropped the once "Dear" and "My Dear"&mdash;used these
adjectively for ceremony's sake,&mdash;the address has lost
so much warmth and all the <em>abandon</em> the words once
implied. Must I withhold expressing all I would, lest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
I should seem to imply more than I meant? And has
one nothing personal and private to communicate? It
were not unbecoming to inquire if our Puritan culture
still held us in check, life and literature were under
eclipse, and the shadow threatening to become central
and total.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of celebrated letters, Pliny's are among the most
delightful. A perusal of them refreshes and restores
the old faith in persons and the possibilities of friendship.
Alas for an age, if indifferent to this antique of virtue,
the fair fellowships it celebrates, in the noble names of
which he gives so many illustrious examples in his
charming pages. Virtue seems something to be sought,
to live and die for, every accomplishment a part of it,
and a possession. I confess to a feeling, as I read, so
modern and consonant to ideas and designs dear to me,
that for the time I seem to recover brothers and friends&mdash;if
it were not egotism to say it&mdash;in the aims and ends
which I have so long loved and still cherish as life's
pursuit and problem. A vein of noble morality pervades
these letters which renders them admirable reading
for all times and ages. And his allusions to his
own life and pursuits, the glimpses he gives of his
friends, commend his pages to all who seek virtue and
wisdom at their sources. To his friend Paternus he
writes with a tenderness and humanity to which the
epithet Christian would add little.</p>

<p>"The sickness which has lately run through my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
family, and carried off several of my domestics, some
of them, too, in the prime of their years, has deeply
afflicted me. I have two consolations, however; while
though they are not adequate to so considerable a loss,
still they are consolations. One is, that as I have always
very readily manumized my slaves, their death does not
seem altogether immature, if they lived long enough
to receive their freedom; the other, that I have allowed
them to make a kind of will, which I observe as religiously
as if they were legally entitled to that privilege.
I receive and obey their last requests as so
many absolute commands, suffering them to dispose of
their effects to whom they please; with this single restriction,
that they leave them to some of the family,
which to persons in their station is to be considered as
a sort of commonwealth. But though I endeavor to
acquiesce under these reflections, yet the same tenderness
which led me to show them these indulgences, still
breaks out and renders me too sensitively affected by
their deaths. However, I would not wish to be incapable
of these tender impressions of humanity, though the
generality of the world, I know, look upon losses of
this kind in no other view than as a diminution of their
property, and fancy, by cherishing such an unfeeling
temper, they discover superior fortitude and philosophy.
Their fortitude and philosophy I will not dispute; but
humane, I am sure they are not; for it is the very
criterion of true manhood to feel those impressions of
sorrow which it endeavors to resist, and to admit not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
to be above the want of consolation. But perhaps I
have detained you too long upon this subject, though
not so long as I would. There is a certain pleasure in
giving vent to one's grief, especially when we pour
out our sorrow in the bosom of a friend, who will approve,
or, at least, pardon our tears. Farewell."</p>

<p>Again to Geminitus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have you never observed a sort of people who,
though they are themselves the abject slaves of every
vice, show a kind of malicious indignation against the
immoral conduct of others, and are the most severe to
those whom they most resemble? Yet surely a beauty
of disposition, even in persons who have least occasion
for clemency themselves, is of all virtues the most becoming.
The highest of character in my estimation, is
His, who is as ready to pardon the moral errors of mankind
as if he were every day guilty of some himself,
and at the same time as cautious of committing a fault
as if he never forgave one. It is a rule, then, which we
should upon all occasions, both private and public, most
religiously observe, <i>to be inexorable to our own failings,
while we treat those of the rest of the world with tenderness,
not excepting even those who forgive none but
themselves</i>, remembering always that the humane, and,
therefore, as well as upon other accounts, the great
Thrasea, used frequently to say, '<i>He who hates vice
hates mankind</i>.' You will ask me, perhaps, who it is
that has given occasion to these reflections. You must
know a certain person lately,&mdash;but of that when we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
meet,&mdash;though, upon second thoughts, not even then,
lest while I condemn and expose his conduct, I should
act counter to that maxim I particularly recommend.
Whoever, therefore, and whatever he is, shall remain in
silence; for though there may be some use, perhaps, in
setting a mark upon the man, for the sake of example,
there will be more, however, in sparing him, for the sake
of humanity."</p>

<p>Again:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There are, it seems," he writes to his friend Septitius,
"certain persons who in your company have
blamed me, as being upon all occasions too lavish in
commendation of my friends. I not only acknowledge
the charge, but glory in it; for, can there be a nobler
error than an overflowing benevolence? But still, who
are these, let me ask, that are better acquainted with
my friends than I am myself? Yet, grant there are such,
why will they deny me the satisfaction of so pleasing
an error? For, supposing my friends deserve not the
high encomiums I give them, certainly I am happy in
believing they do. Let them recommend, then, this
ungenerous discernment to those who imagine (and
their number is not inconsiderable) that they show
their judgment when they indulge their censure. As
for myself, they will never persuade me that I can love
my friends too well."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>How amiable and just are sentiments like these rendering
odious the carping censure and ill-natured criticism
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
which finds free currency between those who, while
meeting as acquaintances, perhaps affecting friendship
for each other, yet speak disparagingly, and are loath to
acknowledge the merit which they see in each other's
character and acquirements. It is safer, and certainly
more becoming, to overpraise than to undervalue and
dispraise another. Faults are apparent enough, and,
for the most part, superficial; in the atmosphere of
affection and respect they fall away presently and disappear
altogether, while virtues may be too deep sometimes
and delicate in expression to be recognized readily
by those who seek for blemishes rather. Modest praise
is the freshest and purest atmosphere for modest virtue
to thrive in and come to maturity. And the most
exalted qualities of character admiration alone brings
into the relief that discloses their proportions and
reveals their lustre. A certain sentiment of worship
insinuates itself into our affections for a near and dear
friend; and while endearing us the more, yet holds us at
the distance of reverence and of self-respect that belongs
to the noblest friendships. 'Tis the poverty of life
that renders friendship poor and cold. I am drawn to
one who, while I approach yet seems distant still; whose
personality has a quality so commanding as to forbid a
familiarity not justified by affection and reason alike,
and whom I never quite come up to, but yet is akin
to me in the attributes that win my regard and insure
my affection. A good man is a bashful man; he affects
all who come within his influence with that grace.

<p>Next to a friend's discourse, no morsel is more
delicious than a ripe book, a book whose flavor is
as refreshing at the thousandth tasting as at the first.
Books when friends weary, conversation flags, or nature
fails to inspire. The best books appeal to the deepest
in us and answer the demand. A book loses if wanting
the personal element, gains when this is insinuated, or
comes to the front occasionally, blending history with
mythology.</p>

<p>My favorite books have a personality and complexion
as distinctly drawn as if the author's portrait were
framed into the paragraphs and smiled upon me as I
read his illustrated pages. Nor could I spare them
from my table or shelves, though I should not open the
leaves for a twelvemonth;&mdash;the sight of them, the
knowledge that they are within reach, accessible at
any moment, rewards me when I invite their company.
Borrowed books are not mine while in hand. I
covet ownership in the contents, and fancy that he who
is conversant with these is the rightful owner, and
moreover, that the true scholar owes to scholars a

catalogue of his chosen volumes, that they may learn
from whence his entertainment during leisure moments.

know how to choose them." And without Plutarch,
no library were complete.</p>

<p>Can we marvel at his fame, or overestimate the surpassing
merits of his writings? It seems as I read as
if none before, none since, had written lives, as if he
alone were entitled to the name of biographer,&mdash;such
intimacy of insight is his, laying open the springs of
character, and through his parallels portraying his times
as no historian had done before: not Plato, even, in the
livelier way of dialogue with his friends. Then his
morals are a statement of the virtues for all times. And
I read the list of his lost writings, not without a sense
of personal wrong done to me, with emotions akin to
what the merchant might feel in perusing the bill of
freight after the loss of his vessel. Hercules, Hesiod,
Pindar, Leonidas, Scipio, Augustus, Claudius, Epaminondas,
minds of mark, all these and other precious
pieces gone to the bottom: his books on the Academy
of Plato, The Philosophers, and many more of this
imperial freight, to be read by none now. Still, there
remains so much to be grateful for; so many names
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
surviving to perpetuate virtue and all that is splendid
in fame, with his own. I for one am his debtor, not for
noble examples alone, but for portraits of the possibilities
of virtue, and all that is dearest in friendship,
in his attractive pages. It is good exercise, good medicine,
the reading of his books,&mdash;good for to-day, as in
times it was preceding ours, salutary reading for all
times.</p>

<p>Montaigne also comes in for a large share of the
scholar's regard. Opened anywhere, his page is sensible,
marrowy, quotable. He may be taken up, too, and
laid aside carelessly without loss, so inconsequent is his
method, and he so careless of his wealth. Professing
nature and honesty of speech, his page has the suggestions
of the landscape, is good for striking out in any
direction, suited to any mood, sure of yielding variety
of information, wit, entertainment,&mdash;not to be commanded,
to be sure, without grave abatements, to be
read with good things growing side by side with things
not such and tasting of the apple. Still, with every
abatement, his book is one of the ripest and mellowest,
and, bulky as it is, we wish there were more of it. He
seems almost the only author whose success warrants in
every stroke of his pen his right to guide it: he of the
men of letters, the prince of letters; since writing of
life, he omits nothing of its substance, but tells all with
a courage unprecedented. His frankness is charming.
So his book has indescribable attractions, being as
it were a Private Book,&mdash;his diary self-edited, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
offered with an honesty that wins his readers, he never
having done bestowing his opulent hospitalities on him,
gossiping sagely, and casting his wisdom in sport to
any who care for it. Everywhere his page is alive and
rewarding, and we are disappointed at finding his book
comes to an end like other books.</p>

<p>Lord Herbert's Autobiography is a like example of
sincerity and naturalness. If he too often play the
cavalier, and is of a temper that brooks not the suspicion
of insult, he is equally eager to defend when
friendship or humanity render it a duty. The brothers,
Edward and George, were most estimable characters.
To George how largely are we in debt for his sacred
verses, the delight and edification of the saints wherever
they are known. Add Vaughan and Crashaw.
And making due allowance for the time when Herrick's
verses were written, his temptation to suit the
tastes of courtiers and kings, his volumes contain
much admirable poetry, tempered with religious devotion.
He wrote sweet and virtuous verse, with lines
here and there that should not have been written.
But he is an antidote to the vice in his lines, and
may well have place in the scholar's library with Donne,
Daniel, Cowley, Shakespeare, and contemporaries.</p>

<p>If one would learn the titles and gain insight into the
contents of the best books in our literature, let him
track Coleridge in his readings and notes as these have
been collected and published in his Literary Remains
and Table Talk. He explored the wide field of literature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and philosophy, and brought to light richer spoils
than any scholar of his time, or since. His reading
was not only choice, but miscellaneous. Nothing of
permanent value appears to have escaped his searching
glance, and his criticisms on books are among the most
valuable contributions to British letters. He knew how
to read to get and give the substance of the book in
sprightly comment and annotation on the text. His
judgments are final and exhaustive. To follow him
were an education in itself.</p>

<p>One's diary is attractive reading, and productive, if
he have the art of keeping one.</p>

<p>Thoreau wrote in his:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I set down such choice experiences that my own
writings may inspire me, and at last I may make
wholes of parts. Certainly it is a distinct profession
to rescue from oblivion and to fix the sentiments and
thoughts which visit all men, more or less, generally,
and that the contemplation of the unfinished picture
may suggest its harmonious completion. Associate
reverently and as much as you can with your loftiest
thoughts. Each thought that is welcomed and recorded
is a nest-egg by the side of which another will be laid.
Thoughts accidentally thrown together become a frame
in which more may be developed and exhibited. Perhaps
this is the main value of a habit of writing or
keeping a journal,&mdash;that is, we remember our best
draught, and stimulate ourselves. My thoughts are
my company. They have a certain individuality and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
separate existence, large personality. Having by
chance recorded a few disconnected thoughts and then
brought them into juxtaposition, they suggest a whole
new field in which it is possible to labor and think.
Thought begets thought. I have a commonplace-book
for facts, and another for poetry. But I find it difficult
always to preserve the vague distinctions which
I had in my mind, for the most interesting and beautiful
facts are so much the more poetry,&mdash;and that is
their success. They are translated from earth to heaven.
I see that if my facts were sufficiently vital and significant,
perhaps transmuted more into the substance of
the human mind, I should need but one book of poetry
to contain them all.</p>

<p>"I do not know but thoughts written down thus in a
journal might be printed in the same form with greater
advantage than if the related ones were brought together
into separate essays. They are allied to life,
and can be seen by the reader not to be far-fetched;
thus, more simple, less artful. I feel that in the other
case, I should have a proper form for my sketches.
Here facts and names and dates communicate more
than we suspect. Whether the flower looks better in
the nosegay than in the meadow where it grew, and
we had to wet our feet to get it? Is the scholastic air
any advantage? Perhaps I can never find so good a
setting for thoughts as I shall thus have taken them out
of. The crystal never sparkles more brightly than in
the cavern. The world have always liked best the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
fable with the moral. The children could read the
fable alone. The grown-up read both. The truth so
told has the best advantages of the most abstract
statement, for it is not the less universally applicable.
Where else will you ever find the true cement for your
thoughts? How will you ever rivet them together without
leaving the marks of your file?</p>

<p>"Yet Plutarch did not so. Montaigne did not so.
Men have written travels in this form; but perhaps no
man's daily life has been rich enough to be journalized.
Yet one's life should be so active and progressive as to
be a journey. But I am afraid to travel much, or to
famous places, lest it might completely dissipate the
mind. Then I am sure that what we observe at home,
if we observe anything, is of more importance than
what we observe abroad. The far-fetched is of least
value. What we observe in travelling are to some
extent the accidents of the body; but what we observe
when sitting at home are in the same proportion
phenomena of the mind itself. A wakeful night will
yield as much thought as a long journey. If I try
thoughts by their quality, not their quantity, I may
find that a restless night will yield more than the
longest journey."</p>

<p>These masterpieces, Thoreau's Diaries, are a choice
mingling of physical and metaphysical elements. They
show the art above art which was busied about their
composition. They come near fulfilling the highest
ends of expression; the things seen become parts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the describer's mind, and speak through his Person.
Quick with thought, his sentences are colored and consolidated
therein by his plastic genius.</p>

<h3><a name="SPECULATIVE_PHILOSOPHY" id="SPECULATIVE_PHILOSOPHY">SPECULATIVE PHILOSOPHY.</a></h3>

<p class='align-right-indent'><span class="smcap">Thursday, 10.</span></p>

<p>The first number of Volume III. of the "Journal
of Speculative Philosophy" comes to hand, printed
in fair type, with promise of attracting attention from
thinkers at home and abroad. And it is a significant
fact that the most appreciative notice yet taken of this
Journal comes from Germany, and is written by the
President of the Berlin Philosophical Society. Nor
less remarkable that this first attempt to popularize
Philosophy, so far as practicable, should date from the
West, and show an ability in dealing with speculative
questions that may well challenge the attainments of
thinkers everywhere,&mdash;the translations showing a ripe
scholarship, and covering almost the whole range of
historic thinking.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
England, too, has at last found a metaphysician
that Coleridge would have accepted and prized. And
the more that he follows himself in introducing philosophy
from Germany into Britain. James Hutchison
Stirling's fervor and strength in advocating Hegel's
ideas command the highest respect. Having had
Schelling's expositor in Coleridge, we now have Hegel's
in Stirling; and, in a spirit of catholicity shown to foreign
thought unexpected in an Englishman, promising
not a little in the way of qualifying favorably the metaphysics
of Britain. Nothing profound nor absolute
can be expected from minds of the type of Mill,
Herbert Spencer, and the rest,&mdash;if not hostile, at least
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
indifferent to and incapable of idealism; naturalists
rather than metaphysicians. It will be a most hopeful
indication if Stirling's book, the "Secret of Hegel,"
find students among his countrymen. Cavilling there
will be, of course, misapprehension, much nonsense
uttered concerning Hegel's Prime Postulates. But
what was thought out fairly in Germany, must find
its way and prompt comprehension in England; if not
there, then here in New England, out of whose heart a
fresh philosophy should spring forth, to which the German
Hegel shall give impulse and furtherance. The
work has already begun, with Harris's publishing the
thoughts of the world's thinkers, himself familiar
with the best of all thinking. I look for a more flowing,
inspiring type of thought, Teutonic as Greek, of a
mystic coloring transcending Boehme, Swedenborg, and
freed from the biblicisms of the schools of our time.
Hegel's secret is that of pure thought akin with that
of Parmenides, Plato, Aristotle, the ancient masters
in philosophy. The One is One out of whose womb the
Not One is born to perish perpetually at its birth.
Whoso pronounces <span class="smcap">Person</span> apprehensively, speaks the
secret of all things, and holds the key to all mysteries
in nature and spirit.</p>

<p>For further encouragement, moreover, we are promised
a translation of the complete works of Plotinus,
by a learned contributor to the "Journal," who has
qualifications for that service unsurpassed, perhaps,
by any on this side of the Atlantic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
He writes from St. Louis:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have tried my hand on Plotinus, and find it easy
to render the text into modern philosophical phraseology.
Until lately I have been unable to procure a
good critical edition of the Greek philosopher. And
now, if my energies are spared, a translation of his
entire works is not very far in the future."<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>It were a good test of one's aptitude for metaphysical
studies, his appreciation of Plotinus. Profound as any
predecessor of the Platonic school of idealism, he had
the remarkable merit of treating ideas in a style at once
transparent and subtle, dealing with these as if they
were palpable things, such was his grasp of thought and
felicity in handling. His themes are of universal concernment
at all times. Promoting a catholic and manly
method, his books were good correctives of any exclusiveness
still adhering in our schools of science and
divinity, while the tendencies of his time, as in ours,
were towards comparative studies.</p>

<p>A like tendency appeared, also, in England in the
studies of the British Platonists, or Latitudinarians,&mdash;Dr.&nbsp;Henry
More, Dr.&nbsp;Cudworth, Dr.&nbsp;Rust, Norris, Glanvil,
John Smith, whose writings deserve a place in theological
libraries, and the study of divines especially.</p>

<p>Norris thus praises his friend Dr.&nbsp;More, whose works
had high repute and were much studied in his day:&mdash;</p>

<p class='verse'>And the great work distinctly share;</p>

<p class='verse'>All science is annexed to thy unerring chair;</p>
<p class='verse'>Some lesser synods of the wise</p>
<p class='verse'>The Muses kept in universities;</p>
<p class='verse'>But never yet till in thy soul</p>

<h4>PLOTINUS.</h4>

<p>Plotinus was by birth an Egyptian, a native of Sycopolis.
He died at the conclusion of the second year
of the reign of M.&nbsp;Aurelius Flavius Claudius, at the
age of sixty-six. On his friend Eustochius coming
from a distance and approaching him when dying, he
said: "As yet I have expected you, and now I endeavor
that my divine part may return to that divine nature
which flourishes throughout the universe."</p>

<p>Taylor says of him, "He was a philosopher pre-eminently
distinguished for the strength and profundity
of his intellect, and the purity and elevation of his life.
He was wise without the usual mixture of human darkness,
and great without the general combination of
human weakness and imperfection. He seems to have
left the orb of light solely for the benefit of mankind,
that he might teach them how to repair the ruin contracted
by their exile from good, and how to return to
their true country and legitimate kindred allies. I do
not mean that he descended into mortality for unfolding
the sublimest truths to the multitude, for this would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
have been a vain and ridiculous attempt, since their
eyes, as Plato justly observes, are not strong enough
to look at truth. But he came as a guide to the few
who are born with a divine destiny, and are struggling
to gain the lost region of light, but know not how to
break the fetters by which they are detained; who are
impatient to leave the obscure cavern of sense, where
all is delusion and shadow, and to ascend to the realms
of intellect, where all is substance and reality."</p>

<p>His biographers speak of him with the truest admiration.
He was foreign from all sophistical ostentation
and pride, and conducted himself in the company of
disputants with the same freedom and ease as in his
familiar discourses; for true wisdom, when it is deeply
possessed, gives affability and modesty to the manners,
illumines the countenance with a divine serenity,
and diffuses over the whole external form an air of dignity
and ease. Nor did he hastily disclose to every one
the logical necessities latent in his conversation. He
was strenuous in discourse, and powerful in discovering
what was appropriate. While he was speaking, there
was every indication of the predominance of intellect
in his conceptions. The light of it diffused itself over
his countenance, which was indeed, at all times, lovely,
but was then particularly beautiful; a certain attenuated
and dewy moisture appeared on his face, and a
pleasing mildness shone forth. Then, also, he exhibited
a gentleness in receiving questions, and demonstrated
a vigor uncommonly robust in their solution.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
He was rapidly filled with what he read, and having in
a few words given the meaning of a profound theory,
he arose. He borrowed nothing from others, his conceptions
being entirely his own, and his theories original.
He could by no means endure to read twice what
he had written. Such, indeed, was the power of his
intellect, that when he had once conceived the whole
disposition of his thoughts from the beginning to the
end, and had afterwards committed them to writing, his
composition was so connected, that he appeared to be
merely transcribing a book. Hence he would discuss
his domestic affairs without departing from the actual
intention of his mind, and at one and the same time
transact the necessary negotiations of friendship, and
preserve an uninterrupted survey of the things he had
proposed to consider. In consequence of this uncommon
power of intellection, when he returned to writing,
after the departure of the person with whom he had
been conversing, he did not review what he had written;
and yet he so connected the preceding with the subsequent
conceptions, as if his composition had not been
interrupted. Hence, he was at the same time present
with others and with himself; so that the self-converted
energy of his intellect was never remitted, except in
sleep, which his admirable temperance in meats and
drinks, and his constant conversion to intellect, contributed
in no small measure to expel. Though he was
attentive to his pupils and the necessary concerns of
life, the intellectual energy of his soul while he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
awake never suffered any interruption from externals,
nor any remission of vigor. He was likewise extremely
mild in his manners, and easy of access to all his
friends and adherents. Hence, so great was his philosophic
urbanity, that though he resided at Rome six
and twenty years, and had been the arbitrator in many
litigious causes which he amicably dissolved, yet he
had scarcely an enemy throughout that vast and illustrious
city. Indeed, he was so highly esteemed, not
only by the senate and people of Rome, that the Emperor
Galienus and his wife Salonica honored his person
and reverenced his doctrine; and relying on his
benevolence, requested that a city in Campania, which
had been formerly destroyed, might be restored, and
rendered a fit habitation for philosophers, and besides
this, that it might be governed by the laws of Plato,
and called Platonopolis.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p class='footnote'><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">8.</span></a> "Nothing is more interesting in the history of the human mind than the
tendency of enlightened souls in all ages to gather in clusters, as in the
material world crystallization goes on by the gathering of individual atoms
about one axis of formation. Thus the schools of Greek Philosophy, the
Pythagorean, the Eleatic, the Peripatetic, the Alexandrian, were human
crystallizations about a central idea, and generally in a given locality,&mdash;as
Samos, Athens, or the Lucanian city of Elea, where Zeno learned lessons
of Parmenides, and whence they both journeyed to Athens in the youth of
Socrates, and held their "Radical Club" at the house of Pythodorus in the
Ceramicus. The Schoolmen and the Mystics of the middle ages clustered
together in the same way about Abelard. Thomas Aquinas, Occam, Gerson,
Giardano Bruno, the early Italian poets, rally in groups in the same way;
so do the Elizabethan Dramatists, the Puritan Politicians, the English Platonists.
Coming nearer our own time, there are the Lake Poets of England,
the Weimar circle of genius, in Germany, the Transcendental Idealists in
Concord and Boston, and finally, the German American Philosophers of St.
Louis, concerning whom we now speak. In all these Schools and Fellowships
of the human soul, a common impulse, aided by accident of locality
and other circumstances, trivial only in appearance, has led to the formation
of that strictest bond, the friendship of united aspirations. New England has
so long been considered the special home of ideas, that it may surprise one
to learn that St. Louis, on the Mississippi, has become the focus of a metaphysical
<em>renaissance</em>; yet such it has become. A few Germans, New Englanders,
and Western men gathered there, having found each other out, began to
meet, expatiate, and confer about Kant and Hegel, Fichte, and Sir William
Hamilton. Soon they formed a Philosophical Society, and by and by, having
accumulated many manuscripts, they began to publish a Magazine of "Speculative
Philosophy." At first, this publication came out semi-occasionally,
but finally settled down into a regular Quarterly, with contributors on both
sides of the Atlantic, and from various schools of metaphysical thought.
The January number is, indeed, a remarkable production. Every article is
good, and most of them profound; no such collection of striking varieties of
philosophic thought has been made public for a long time as this. The
Journal is edited by William T. Harris, <span class="smcap">ll.d.</span>, Superintendent of the Public
Schools of St. Louis."</p>

"to draw up a critical, and, where possible, biographical account of the Latitudinarian
party at Cambridge, from the reign of James I to the latter half
of Charles II. The greater number were Platonists, so called, at least, and
such they believed themselves to be, but more truly Plotinists. Thus Cudworth,
Dr.&nbsp;Jackson (chaplain of Charles I and Vicar of Newcastle upon
Tyne), Henry More, John Smith, and some others (Norris, Glanvil). Jeremy
Taylor was a Gassendist, and, as far as I know, he is the only exception.
They were alike admirers of Grotius, which, in Taylor, was consistent with
the tone of all his philosophy. The whole party, however, and a more amiable
never existed, were scared and disgusted into this by the catachrestic language
and the skeleton half truths of the systematic divines of the synod of
Dort on the one hand, and by the sickly broodings of the Pietists and Solomon's
Song preachers on the other. What they all wanted was a pre-inquisition
into the mind, as part organ, part constituent, of all knowledge,&mdash;an
examination of the scales and weights and measures themselves abstracted
from the objects to be weighed or measured by them; in short, a transcendental
&aelig;sthetic, logic, and noetic. Lord Herbert was at the entrance of, nay,
already some paces within, the shaft and adit of the mine; but he turned
abruptly back, and the honor of establishing a complete

<p class='align-right-indent'><span class="smcap">Thursday, 17.</span></p>

<p>The new courses of lectures at Harvard University
are advertised by the new President. They are a
novelty in our college culture. A marked peculiarity
is the announcement of a course to be given by Emerson,
on the Natural History of Intellect; by Dr.
Hedge, on Theism, Atheism, and Pantheism; and by
J. Eliot Cabot, on Kant. The course, or any part of
it, is open "to graduates, teachers, and other competent
persons, men or women."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>It is hoped, also, that Hutchison Stirling may be
added to the list of lecturers,&mdash;an acquisition certainly
that Harvard should be proud to secure, both for its
own and the credit of metaphysical studies on this side
of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>The English mind seems to have held aloof from
pure metaphysics,&mdash;from German Idealism, especially.
Berkeley, its finest thinker since Bacon, was for a long
time misapprehended, if, indeed, he is fairly appreciated
as yet. Boehme, Kant, Schelling, were unknown till
Coleridge introduced their ideas to the notice of his
contemporaries&mdash;Carlyle those of Goethe, and the great
scholars of Germany.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Great, indeed," says Coleridge, "are the obstacles
which an English metaphysician has to encounter.
Amongst his most respectable and intelligent judges,
there will be many who have devoted their attention
exclusively to the concerns and interests of human life,
and who bring with them to the perusal of philosophical
systems, an habitual aversion to all speculations, the
utility and application of which are not evident and
immediate.</p>

<p>"There are others whose prejudices are still more
formidable, inasmuch as they are grounded in their
moral feelings and religious principles, which had been
alarmed and shocked by the injurious and pernicious
tenets defended by Hume, Priestley, and the French
Fatalists, or Necessitarians, some of whom had perverted
metaphysical reasonings to the denial of the mysteries,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and, indeed, of all the peculiar doctrines of Christianity;
and others, to the subversion of all distinctions
between right and wrong.</p>

<p>"A third class profess themselves friendly to metaphysics,
and believe that they are themselves metaphysicians.
They have no objection to system and terminology
provided it be the method and nomenclature to
which they have been familiarized in the writings of
Locke, Hume, Hartley, Condillac, or, perhaps, Dr.&nbsp;Reid
and Professor Stewart.</p>

<p>"But the worst and widest impediment remains. It
is the predominance of a popular philosophy, at once
the counterfeit and mortal enemy of all true and manly
metaphysical research. It is that corruption introduced
by certain immethodical aphorisming Eclectics,
who, dismissing, not only all system, but all logical
consequence, pick and choose whatever is most plausible
and showy; who select whatever words can have
semblance of sense attached to them, without the least
expenditure of thought; in short, whatever may enable
men to talk of what they do not understand, with a
careful avoidance of everything that might awaken
them to a moment's suspicion of their ignorance."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fifty years and more have passed since this criticism
was written; and, with slight change of names for similar
things, it still holds for the popular estimate put
upon metaphysics by too many scholars of our time.
If Coleridge, Schelling, Hegel, and the rest, are still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
held in disregard by persons in chairs of philosophy,
we may infer the kind of culture which the universities
favor. What he also said of intellectual culture in
his country and time, holds scarcely less true as regards
ours; and this in a republic, too, which in theory
educates all its citizens.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I am greatly deceived if one preliminary to an
efficient popular education be not the recurrence to a
more manly discipline of the intellect on the part of
the learned themselves; in short, a thorough recasting
of the moulds in which the minds of our gentry, the
characters of our future landowners, magistrates, and
senators, are to receive their shape and fashion. What
treasures of practical wisdom would be once more
brought to open day by the solution of the problem.
Suffice it for the present to hint the master thought.</p>

<p>"The first man on whom the light of an Idea dawned,
did in that same moment receive the spirit and credentials
of a lawgiver. And as long as man shall exist, so
long will the possession of that antecedent&mdash;the maker
and master of all profitable experience, which exists
in the power of an idea&mdash;be the one lawful qualification
for all dominion in the world of the senses. Without
this, experience itself is but a Cyclops walking backwards
under the fascinations of the past; and we are
indebted to a lucky coincidence of outward circumstances
and contingencies, least of all to be calculated
on in a time like the present, if this one-eyed experience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
does not seduce its worshippers into practical
anachronisms. But, alas! the halls of the old philosophers
have been so long deserted, that we circle them at
shy distance, as the haunt of phantoms and chimeras.
The sacred grave of Academus is held in like regard with
the unfruitful trees in the shadowy world of Maro, that
had a dream attached to every leaf. The very terms
of ancient wisdom are worn out; or, far worse, stamped
as baser metal; and whoever should have the hardihood
to re-proclaim its solemn truths, must commence with a
glossary."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Dialectic, or Method of the Mind, constitutes the
basis of all culture. Without a thorough discipline in
this, our schools and universities give but a showy and
superficial training. The knowledge of mind is the
beginning of all knowledge; without this a theology is
baseless, the knowledge of God impossible. Modern
education has not dealt with these deeper questions of
life and being. It has the future in which to prove
its power of conducting a Cultus, answering to the
discipline of the Greek thinkers, Pythagoras, Plato,
Aristotle.</p>

<p>As yet we deal with mind with far less certainty than
with matter; the realm of intellect having been less
explored than the world of the senses, and both are
treated conjecturally rather than absolutely. When we
come to perceive that Intuition is the primary postulate
of all intelligence, most questions now perplexing and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
obscure will become transparent; the lower imperfect
methods then take rank where they belong and are
available. The soul leads the senses; the reason the
understanding; imagination the memory; instinct and
intuition include and prompt the Personality entire.</p>

<p>The categories of imagination are the poet's tools;
those of the reason, the implements of the naturalist.
The dialectic philosopher is master of both. The tools
to those only who can handle them skilfully. All others
but gash themselves and their subject, at best. Ask
not a man of understanding to solve a problem in
metaphysics. He has neither wit, weights, nor scales
for the task. But a man of reason or of imagination
solves readily the problems of understanding the moment
these are fairly stated. Ideas are solvents of all
mysteries, whether in matter or mind.</p>

<p>Yet the deepest truths are best read between the
lines, and, for the most part, refuse to be written.
Who tells all tells falsely. There are untold
subtleties in things seen as unseen. Only the idealist
touches the core of their secret tenderly, and extracts
the mystery; Nature, like the coy Isis, disclosing these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
to none else. Most edifying is the author who suggests,
and leaves to his reader the pleasure and profit
of following his thought into its various relations with
the whole of things, thus stimulating him to explore
matters to their issues. The great masters have
observed this fine law, and of modern scholars
especially Goethe.</p>

<p>For whether considered as poet or naturalist, he is our
finest example of the reverent faith in nature and tenderness
of treatment that becomes her student and devotees.
And hence the rich spoils and prime suggestions
with which he charms and rewards in his books. Wooed
in this spirit, nature vouchsafed him the privilege of
reading her secrets. An eye-witness of the facts, he
had the magic pen to portray them as they rose midway
between matter and mind, there caught them lovingly
and held them forth in intertwisted myths and gay
marriages to the sense and sentiment of his reader.
Writing faithfully to the form of things, he yet had a
finer moral than these could deliver; the vein of quiet
mysticism in which he delighted, giving a graceful charm
to the writing. How finely his senses symbolized his
thought, and his eye how Olympian! What subtle perception
of the contraries in character! He has treated
the strife of the Worst for the Best, the problem of evil,
more cunningly than any; than Moses; than the author
of Job of Uz; than Milton, the Puritan, fitted as he was
alike by birth and culture to deal with this world fable,&mdash;his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
faith in nature being so entire, his rare gifts at
instant command for rendering perfect copies of what
he saw, and loved to represent in its truthfulness to
sense and soul alike. A seer of Spirit, the
draughtsman of guile; to him sat the demons gladly,
and he sketched their likenesses,&mdash;portraits of the
dualities he knew so well; the same with which most
are too familiar; the drama of the temptation being
coeval with man, the catastrophe thus far repeated disastrously,
the striving of the Many against the One, the
world-spirit bribing the will, proffering the present delights
for the future pains. Ah! could he but have
found himself in the One, whom, with such surpassing
skill he individualized, but failed to impersonate. His
aloofness from life, his residence in the Many, his inability
to identify himself with the whole of things,&mdash;this
duplicity of genius denied him free admittance to
unity. Cunning he was, not wise in the simplicity of
wisdom. As the Fates conceived, so they slew him,
yet by subtleties so siren, as to persuade him of an immortality
not theirs to bestow. All he was, his Faust
celebrates&mdash;admitted to heaven, as Goethe to glory,
without the fee that opens honestly its gates.</p>

<p>Oh, artist of beauty! Couldst thou but have been
equal to portray the Spirit of spirits as cunningly as of
Matter! But it was the temper of that age of transition,
and thou wast its priest and poet.</p>

<p>But whatever his deficiencies, he has been one of the
world's teachers, and is to be for some time to come.
The spirit and movement of an age are embodied in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
books, and one reads with a growing reverence at every
perusal of the mind that saw and has portrayed the
world-spirit so well. If not the man complete that in
our admiration of his genius we could desire, he yet
was faithful to the law of his pen, and therewith justifies
his existence to mankind. Nor do I find any of his
contemporaries who made as much of this human life
during his century. "Light, more light!" With this
request he passed behind the clouds into the fullest
radiance.</p>

<h4>CARLYLE.</h4>

<p>The ancients accepted in good faith the sway of Fate,
or Temperament, in their doctrine of Destinies, hereby
signifying that duplicity or polarity of forces operative
in man's Will by which his personal freedom is abridged,
if not overridden. Nor does it appear that they conceived
deliverance possible from this dread Nemesis of
existence; it was wrought into the substance of their
tragedies, binding matter and mind alike in chains.
If the modern thought professes to be freed from this
Old Fatalism, it practically admits it, nevertheless;
man's will being still bound in fetters by inexorable
powers, which his Choice can neither propitiate nor
overcome. If Goethe treats the matter more forcibly,
sharply, his dealing differs but in form from the Pagan;
man is the spoil of the demons still. Satan is suppressed
for the moment to be victorious in the end.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Carlyle only renders it the more inexorable and dismaying
by all his wealth of thought, force of illustration,
his formidable historical figures, dramatic genius.
It is force pitted against force that he celebrates
throughout his embattled pages; a victim himself with
his heroes, yet like them never the victor; all irritants,
but not quellers of the demon; fixed forces in transition
times.</p>

<p>Only seen from this, his habitual standpoint and outlook,
is he justified as the consistent realist, holding
fast his faith in the actual facts of the world, their
rigorous following to the remotest issues,&mdash;the most
heroic of thinkers. What if, with these dread convictions
and insights of his, he paint out of all keeping
with the actual facts; he is following logically his persuasions
of the destinies that sway human concerns,
abating not an iota of the letter of the text of the dread
decalogue, whether for the wicked or the weak; defending
his view of the right at all costs whatsoever.
Justice first, mercy afterwards. His books opened
anywhere show him berating the wrong he sees, but
seldom the means of removing. There is ever the
same melancholy advocacy of work to be done under
the dread master: force of strokes, the right to rule
and be ruled, the dismal burden. He rides his Leviathan
as fiercely as did his countryman, Hobbes; can
be as truculent and abusive. Were he not thus fatally
in earnest, we should take him for the harlequin he
often seems, not seeing the sorrowing sadness thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
playing off its load in this grotesque mirth, this scornful
irony of his; he painting in spite of himself his portraits
in the warmth of admiration, the blaze of wrath,
giving us mythology for history mostly.</p>

<p>Yet with what breadth of perspective he paints these!
strength of outline, the realism appalling, the egotism
enormous,&mdash;all history showing in the background of
his one figure, Carlyle,&mdash;Burns, Goethe, Richter, Mirabeau,
Luther, Cromwell, Frederick,&mdash;all dashed from
his flashing pen,&mdash;heads of himself alike in their unlikeness,
prodigiously individual, wilful, some of them
monstrous; all Englishmen, too, with their egregious
prejudices, prides; no patience, no repose in any. He
brandishes his truncheon through his pages with an
adroitness that renders it unsafe for any, save the few
wielding weapons of celestial temper, to do battle
against Abaddon.</p>

<p>Nor will he be silenced; talking terribly against all
talking but his own; agreeing, disagreeing, all the
same, he the Jove permitting none, none, to mount
Olympus till the god deign silence and invite. Curious
to see him monologizing, his chin aloft, the pent thunders
rolling, lightnings darting from under his bold brows,
words that tell of the wail within, accents not meant
for music, yet made lyrical in the cadences of his
Caledonian refrain, his mirth mad as Lear's, his humor
wilful as the winds. Not himself then is approachable
by himself even.</p>

<p>A lovable man, nevertheless, with a great heart in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
breast, sympathies the kindliest, deepest, nor indifferent
to the ills the flesh is heir to. Why, oh ye powers, this
wretchedness amidst the means superabounding for relieving
and preventing it? Why this taking up reform
forever from the beggar and felon side, as if these were
sole credentials to sympathy, essential elements of the
social state? Rather let force, persistent yet beneficent,
be brought to bear upon mankind, giving alike to prince
and people the dutiful drill that alone equips for the
tasks of life,&mdash;this were the State's duty, the province
of rulers; a thing to set about at once with the vigor
of righteousness that justice demands for the rule of
the world.</p>

<p>The way of Imperialism this, and playing Providence
harshly. He mistakes in commending absolutism to republicans,
especially in times like ours. England, even,
imperial as she is, is too intelligent and free to accept it.
America certainly cannot. If he would but believe in
the people, divide his faith in hero-worship with masses,
also. But it is not easy for a Briton to comprehend
properly republican institutions like ours. Nothing
short of success against large odds can convince him
of the feasibility, the safety of a popular government.</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>"Success, success; to thee, to thee,</p>
<p class='verse'>As to a god, he bends the knee."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Not one of his heroes would serve our turn. Frederick
were perhaps a fit captain to dominate over a
brute multitude; Cromwell might serve in a state of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
revolution, but must fail altogether at reconstruction.
Even Milton, the republican, would hardly avail with
republicans freed from the old British love of sway.</p>

<p>It is not safe for any to dwell long on Sinai, leaving
the multitudes meanwhile to their idolatries below. In
rigors thus austere the humanities perish. Justice and
mercy must alike conspire in the fulfilment of the decalogue,
lest vengeance break the tables and shatter the
divine image also.</p>

with compassion."</p>

<p>And the republic now begins to look sweet and
beautiful again, as if men and patriotic citizens
might walk upright without shame or apologies of any
sort. Having managed for a century or more to keep
the black man under foot, provoked a war to this end,
and, in our straits, availed of his life to spare ours, let
us cherish the faith that we are bent honestly now on
securing him the rights which his courage and loyalty
have won for him and his while the republic stands.
Was this slaughter of men and expenditure of treasure,
with the possible woes to come, necessary to make us
just? And shall we not be careful hereafter that political
parties play not false as before the war; the cry
for union and reconstruction but a specious phrase for
reinstating the old issues under new names? Admitted
into the Union, the once rebellious States may break
out into new atrocities for recovering their fallen fortunes.
It behooves the friends of freedom and human
rights to know their friends, and trust those, and only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
those, who have proved themselves faithful in the dire

<p>In democratic times like ours, when Power is stealing
the world over from the few to the many, and with
an impetus unprecedented in the world's history, the
rightful depositories of Power, the People, should make
sure that their representatives are fitted alike and disposed
to administer affairs honorably; the rule being
that of the Best by the Best,&mdash;an aristocracy in essence
as in name; since no calamity can befall a people like
the want of good heads to give it stability and self-respect
in its own, or consideration in the eyes of
foreign beholders. Ideas are the royal Presidents;
States and peoples intelligent and prosperous as they
are loyal to these Potentates. Liberty is the highest
of trusts committed to man by his Creator, and in the
enjoyment of which man becomes himself a creator,&mdash;a
trust at once the most sacred and most difficult to
hold inviolate. "Power is a fillet that presses so hard
the temples that few can take it up safely." Right is
the royal ruler alone, and he who rules with least
restraint comes nearest to empire.</p>

<p>And one of the most hopeful aspects of our national
affairs is the coming into importance and power of
plain, sensible men, like Grant and Boutwell,&mdash;men
owing their places to their honesty and useful services,&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
one in the field, the other in the state. Our village,
also, is honored by the elevation of one of its distinguished
citizens for his eminent legal attainments and
personal integrity. This change for the better in our
politics, it seems, came in with President Lincoln, himself
the plainest of the plain, one of the most American
of American men; is (after his successor's lamentable
career) now reinstated in our present chief
magistrate, whose popularity is scarcely secondary to
any of his predecessors in the Presidential Chair. Our
national politics have obviously improved in these
respects upon later administrations, and we may reasonably
hope for the prevalence of peace and prosperity,
such as the country has not enjoyed since the times of
Washington and Franklin. The reign of principle
appears to have returned into the administration of
affairs, honorable men taking the lead, softening,
in large measure, the asperities and feuds of
parties. Great questions affecting the welfare of the
community, and for the solution of which the ablest
heads are requisite, are coming into discussion, and
are to be settled for the benefit, we trust, of all concerned.
Reform in capital and labor, temperance,
woman's social and political condition, popular education,
powers of corporations, international communication,&mdash;these
and the new issues which their settlement
will effect, must interest and occupy the active
forces of the country to plant the republic, upon
stable foundations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
"An early, good education," says Gray, in his notes
on Plato's Republic, "is the best means of turning the
eyes of the mind from the darkness and uncertainty of
popular opinion, to the clear light of truth. It is the
interest of the public neither to suffer unlettered and
unphilosophical minds to meddle with government, nor
to allow men of knowledge to give themselves up for
the whole of life to contemplation; as the first will lack
principle to guide them, and others want practice and
inclination to business." One might also commend to
senators and representatives this sentence from Tacitus:
"I speak," he says, "of popular eloquence, the genuine
offspring of that licentiousness to which fools and designing
men have given the name of liberty. I speak
of that bold and turbulent oratory, that inflamer of the
people, and constant companion of sedition, that fierce
incendiary that knows no compliance, and scorns to
temporize,&mdash;busy, rash, and arrogant, but, in quiet
and well-regulated governments, utterly unknown."
Yet I cannot say that I should have written, with my
present notion of political or religious obligation, what
follows: "Upon the whole, since no man can enjoy a
state of calm tranquillity, and, at the same time, raise a
great and splendid reputation; to be content with the
benefits of the age in which we live, without detracting
from our ancestors, is the virtue that best becomes us."
The sentiment has a patriotic sound, but conceals the
cardinal truth, dear to a patriot, certainly in our times
and republic, that a calm tranquillity is hardly compatible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
with a life of heroic action, and that true progress,
so far from detracting from the glory of our ancestors,
carries forward that for which they battled and bled,
to clothe them and their descendants with a fresher and
more enduring fame. Not in imitation of such inflamers
of the people, but in the spirit of liberty and loyalty,
have Sumner and Phillips won great and splendid reputations,
if not silenced the fools and designing
men whose bold and turbulent oratory, the genuine
offspring of licentiousness, once sounded in our national
halls, and came near the separation of our
Union.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Phillips stands conspicuous above most of his time,
as the advocate of human rights, the defender of the
oppressed. By happy fortune, he enjoys the privilege
denied to senators, of speaking unencumbered by convention
or caucus. His speeches have the highest
qualities of an orator. In range of thought, clearness
of statement, keen satire, brilliant wit, personal anecdote,
wholesome moral sentiment, the Puritan spirit,
they are unmatched by any of the great orators of his
time. They have, besides, the rare merit, and one in
which our public men have been painfully deficient, of
straightforwardness and truth to the hour. They are
addressed to the conscience of the country, are spoken
in the interest of humanity. Many a soldier in the
field during the late war, many a citizen owes his loyalty
to hearing his eloquent words.</p>

<p>Above party, unless it be the honorable and ancient
party of mankind, they embody the temper and drift of
the times. How many public men are here to survive
in the pillory of his indignant invectives! The history
of the last thirty years cannot be accurately written
without his facts and anecdotes. There is no great interest
of philanthropy in which he has not been, and
still is, active. His words are to be taken as those of
an earnest mind intent on furthering the ends of justice,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
interpreted not by their rhetoric, but strict adherence
to principle. Certainly the country has at times hung
in the balance of his argument; cabinets and councils
hesitating to do or undo without some regard to his
words, well knowing the better constituency which he
better represents and speaks for,&mdash;the people, namely,
whose breath can unmake as it has made.</p>

<p>An earnest, truthful man, he has not shared with
other statesmen of his time in their indifferency nor
their despair; and if by some esteemed a demagogue
and disorganizer, such is not his estimate of
the part taken by him in the great issues of the past,
political and social. The friend of progress, he early
threw himself into the conflict, addressed himself to
the issues as they rose, rose with them and rode the wave
bravely; sometimes hastening, oftentimes provoking the
crisis. What States would not adventure upon as policy,
he espoused as policy and humanity both. Addressing
himself from the first to the great middle class, whose
principles are less corrupted by party politics, in
whom the free destiny of peoples is lodged, he is
gathering the elements of power and authority which,
becoming formidable in ability if not in numbers, must
secure the country's confidence, and in due time have
political dictation and rule.</p>

<p>Then, of the new instrumentalities for agitation and
reform, the free Platform derives largely its popularity
and efficiency from his genius. Consider the freedom
of speech it invites and maintains, free as the freest can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
make it, a stand whereon every one who will gains a
hearing; every opinion its widest scope of entertainment,&mdash;the
widest hospitality consistent with the decorum of
debate. Hither comes any one breathing a sentiment of
progress, any daring to dissent against dissent, against
progress itself. Here the sexes meet on fair terms.
Here, as not elsewhere, is intimated, if not spoken fittingly,
the popular spirit and tendency. Here come the
most effective speakers by preference to address a
free constituency, a constituency to be theirs, if not
already, their words leaping into type from their lips,
to be spread forthwith to the four winds by the reporting
press. 'Tis a school of debate, for oratory, for
thought, for practice; has the remarkable merit of
freshness, originality; questions affecting the public
welfare being here anticipated, first deliberated upon
by the people themselves; systems of agitation organized
and set on foot for creating a wholesome popular
sentiment; in short, for giving inspiration, a culture, to
the country, which the universities cannot; training the
reason and moral sense by direct dealing with principles
and persons as occasion requires; a school from
whence have graduated not a few of our popular
speakers,&mdash;the Orator himself, whose speeches furnish
passages for collegiate declamation, from which politicians
plume their rhetoric to win a borrowed fame.
Cato said, "An orator was a good man skilled in the
art of speaking."</p>

<p>More than any lecturer, unless it be Emerson, he has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
made the lecture a New-England, if not an American
institution; is always heard with profit and pleasure
by the unprejudiced auditor,&mdash;any course in the cities
and towns being thought incomplete without his. Nor
is it easy to estimate the debt of the free States to his
speeches before associations, conventions, in pulpits, the
humblest places where his words could be secured. He
has already taken his place beside Garrison, has linked
his name with the Liberator's, to be on men's lips while
the word <em>slave</em> has significance.</p>

<p>If there be any one to whom the country is more
largely indebted than another for eminent services in
his day, it must be Garrison; unless a doubt may
arise in the minds of some, if the hero of Harper's
Ferry be not entitled to like honors, since to these
illustrious men must be attributed the merit of having
struck the most effective blows for the overthrow of
slavery, the one inaugurating the era of emancipation,
and the other consummating it.</p>

<div class='container-center'>

<p>The agitation and outside pressure which they were
chiefly instrumental in furthering to its rightful issues,
were the most powerful auxiliaries, if not the power
itself, which emancipated the mind of the country from
its subserviency to the slave dominion. They were the
creators of the sentiment that freed the negro at last
from his bonds and cleared the way for a true Republican
State. Some power superior to the Constitution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
was required to revise it, and free the whole people
from this Arachne's coil that had bound them so long;
was especially needed to extricate the rulers themselves
from its meshes, and to rescue the rights thus imperilled
by unscrupulous placemen who shrunk from the
task. These could not help them, caught in the same
snare that bound the nation. "Neither the law, nor the
Constitution, nor the whole system of American institutions,"
they were told, "ever had contemplated a case as
likely to arise under our system in which a resort would
be necessary to provide outside of the law and Constitution
for amending the Constitution." The case arose,
nevertheless, and was provided for by these powerful
agitators, and by the progress of events. The late civil
outbreak compelled the necessary amendments, sweeping
the compromises, the slave Congress and territory from
the statute books and the country itself.</p>

<div class='container-center'>

<p>"To all new truths, all renovations of old truths," says
Coleridge, "it must be as in the ark between the destroyed
and the about-to-be-renovated world. The raven must
be sent out before the dove, and ominous controversy
must precede peace and the olive wreath."</p>

<h4>GREELEY.</h4>

<p>Of political editors, next to Garrison, perhaps Horace
Greeley was the most efficient in furthering this national
result; and by his eminent services in various departments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
of activity comes nearest to being the people's
man, the best representative of character indigenous to
New England, or more properly America&mdash;like Beecher
and Phillips. His power appears to lie in his strong
understanding, abundant information, plain statement
of his facts, freed from all rhetorical embellishment.
A rustic Franklin in his direct way of putting his
things before his auditor, he makes plain his meaning in
spite of his utter want of all graces of person, or of oratory,
handling his subject as a rude farmer his axe and
crowbar. There is about him a homely charm of good-nature,
a child-like candor, that have all the effect of
eloquence, elevating him for the time into the subject
he treats. In the statistics of things, practical and
political, he is a kind of living encyclopedia of information,
and as his chief distinction has made the newspaper
a power it had not been before.</p>

<p>Ours can hardly claim to be the Golden Age, but
of Bronze and Iron rather. If ideas are in the
ascendant, still mind is fettered by mechanism. We
scale the heavens to grade the spaces. Messrs. Capital
&amp; Co. transact our business for us the globe over.
Was it in the Empire News that I read the company's
advertisement for supplying mankind with
gas at a penny <i xml:lang='la' lang='la'>per diem</i> annually? And then,
proceeding to say, "that considering the old-time
monopoly in the heavenly luminary, the corporation has
constructed at fabulous cost their Brazen Cope to shut
down upon the horizon at day-break punctually, and so
graduate to each customer's tube his just allowance,
else darkness for delinquents the year round."</p>

<p>Certainly a splendid conception for distributing sunbeams
by the Globe Corporation if the solar partner
consent to the speculation. Had Hesiod the enterprise
in mind when he sung,&mdash;</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>"Seek virtue first, and after virtue, coin"?</p>
</div></div>

<p class='no-indent'>Or St. Paul, when writing concerning labor and capital:
"For I would not," he says, "that other men
should be eased and you burdened, but by an equality
that now at the time your abundance may be a supply
for their want, that their abundance may also be a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
supply for your want, that there may be an equality, as
it is written, He that had gathered much, had nothing
over, and he that had gathered little, had no lack.
If any man will not work, neither should he eat."</p>

<p>Any attempt to simplify and supply one's wants by
abstinence and self-help is in the most hopeful direction,
and serviceable to the individual whether his experiment
succeed or not, the practice of most, from
the beginning, having been to multiply rather than
diminish one's natural wants, and thus to become poor
at the cost of becoming rich. "Who has the fewest
wants," said Socrates, "is most like God."</p>

<p>Our "Fruitlands" was an adventure undertaken in
good faith for planting a Family Order here in New
England, in hopes of enjoying a pastoral life with a few
devoted men and women, smitten with sentiments of the
old heroism and love of holiness and of humanity. But
none of us were prepared to actualize practically the
ideal life of which we dreamed. So we fell apart, some
returning to the established ways, some soured by the
trial, others postponing the fulfilment of his dream to
a more propitious future.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
I certainly esteem it an inestimable privilege to
have been bred to outdoor labors, the use of tools, and
to find myself the owner of a garden, with the advantage
of laboring sometimes besides my faithful Irishman,
and compare views of men and things with him.
I think myself the greater gainer of the two by this
intercourse. Unbiassed by books, and looking at
things as they stand related to his senses and simple
needs, I learn naturally what otherwise I should not
have known so well, if at all. The sympathy and
sincerity are the best part of it. One sees the more
clearly his social relations and duties; sees the need of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
beneficent reforms in the economics of labor and capital
by which the working classes shall have their just claims
allowed, the products of hand and brain be more equitably
distributed, a finer sympathy and wiser humanity
prevail in the disposition of affairs. No true man can
be indifferent to that great productive multitude, without
whose industry capitalists would have nothing in
which to invest; the callings and the professions lack
bread and occupation alike. Head and hands best
co-operate in this interplay of services. Every gift, besides
enriching its owner, should enrich the whole community,
opportunities be opened for the free exercise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
of all, the golden rule stand for something besides
an idle text. Every one is entitled to a competence,
provided he employs his gifts for the common
good. It seems but right that the gifted should return
to the common treasury in the ratio of their endowments;
be taxed at a higher rate than those to whom
like advantages have been denied. Indeed, it is questionable
whether the man who is poor by no fault of his,
should be taxed at all; give him citizenship rather as an
inborn right, as a man, not as a mere producer. Men are
loyal from other considerations than self-interest. One
would not check the spirit of accumulation, but the
monopoly of the gift for the sole benefit of the oppressor.
A competence, including every comfort, and
even harmless luxuries, is what all men need, all desire,
all might have, were there a fair distribution of the
avails of labor, opportunities for labor of head or hand
for all,&mdash;the right to be educated and virtuous included,
as the most important. The poor man cannot compete,
practically, successfully, with the rich man, the laborer
with the capitalist, the ignorant with the instructed,&mdash;all
are placed at unequal odds, the victims of circumstances
which they did not create, and which those who
do may use to their injury if they choose. The laborer
is broken on the wheel his necessities compel him to
drive, feeling the while the wrong done him by those
whom he has enriched by his toil.</p>

<p>No tradition assigns a beginning to justice, but only
to injustice. Before the Silver, the Brazen, the Iron,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
comes the Golden Age, when virtue is current, and
man at his highest value. It is when man is degraded
that virtue and justice are dishonored, and labor deemed
disreputable.</p>

<p>Poverty may be the philosopher's ornament. Too
rich to need, and self-respecting to receive benefits,
save upon terms which render the receiver the nobler
giver, he revenges upon fortune by possessing a kingdom
superior to mischance and incumbrance.</p>

<p class='footnote-cont'>"We have received a communication from Messrs. Alcott and Lane, dated
from their farm, <span class='property-names'>Fruitlands</span>, in Harvard, Massachusetts, from which we
make the following extract:&mdash;</p>

<p class='footnote-cont'>"'We have made an arrangement with the proprietor of an estate of about
a hundred acres, which liberates this tract from human ownership. For
picturesque beauty, both in the near and the distant landscape, the spot has
few rivals. A semicircle of undulating hills stretches from south to west,
among which the Wachusett and Monadnock are conspicuous. The vale,
through which flows a tributary to the Nashua, is esteemed for its fertility
and ease of cultivation, is adorned with groves of nut trees, maples, and
pines, and watered by small streams. Distant not thirty miles from the
metropolis of New England, this reserve lies in a serene and sequestered dell.
No public thoroughfare invades it, but it is entered by a private road. The
nearest hamlet is that of Stillriver, a field's walk of twenty minutes, and the
village of Harvard is reached by circuitous and hilly roads of nearly three
miles.</p>

<p class='footnote-cont'>"'Here we prosecute our effort to initiate a Family in harmony with the
primitive instincts in man. The present buildings being ill placed and unsightly
as well as inconvenient, are to be temporarily used, until suitable
and tasteful buildings in harmony with the natural scene can be completed.
An excellent site offers itself on the skirts of the nearest wood, affording
shade and shelter, and commanding a view of the lands of the estate, nearly
all of which are capable of spade culture. It is intended to adorn the pastures
with orchards, and to supersede ultimately the labor of the plough and
cattle, by the spade and the pruning-knife.</p>

<p class='footnote-cont'>"'Our planting and other works, both without and within doors, are already
in active progress. The present Family numbers ten individuals, five
being children of the founders. Ordinary secular farming is not our object.
Fruit, grain, pulse, garden plants and herbs, flax and other vegetable products
for food, raiment, and domestic uses, receiving assiduous attention,
afford at once ample manual occupation, and chaste supplies for the bodily
needs. Consecrated to human freedom, the land awaits the sober culture of
devout men.</p>

<p class='footnote-cont'>"'Beginning with small pecuniary means, this enterprise must be rooted
in a reliance on the succors of an ever-bounteous Providence, whose vital
affinities being secured by this union with uncorrupted fields and unworldly
persons, the cares and injuries of a life of gain are avoided.</p>

<p class='footnote-cont'>"'The inner nature of every member of the Family is at no time neglected.
A constant leaning on the living spirit within the soul should consecrate
every talent to holy uses, cherishing the widest charities. The choice
Library (of which a partial catalogue was given in Dial No. XII) is accessible
to all who are desirous of perusing these records of piety and wisdom.
Our plan contemplates all such disciplines, cultures, and habits as evidently
conduce to the purifying and edifying of the inmates. Pledged to the Spirit
alone, the founders can anticipate no hasty or numerous accession to their
numbers. The kingdom of peace is entered only through the gates of self-denial
and abandonment; and blessedness is the test and the reward of
obedience to the unswerving law of Love.&mdash;<cite>The Dial.</cite></p>

<p>Mr.&nbsp;Alcott began the conversation by referring
to that of Monday before, on the subject of
Temperament and Complexion, and added other fine
thoughts about it.</p>

<p>He said, perhaps he had dwelt too much on the symbol
of color, but conceived himself borne out in all he
had said. "The Greeks held that a brown complexion
betokened courage, and those who had fair skins were
called children of light and favorites of the gods. And
the gods themselves were demonic or divine, as tempered
by darkness or light,&mdash;the gods Infernal, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Midgods, the Celestials. So Christian art has painted
Satan dark, the Christ fair. And late experiments on
the sunbeam showed that dark substances imprison the
rays,&mdash;these absorbing more and delivering less. The
more of sun, so much the more of soul; the less of
sun, of passion more, and the strange fire." He fancied
black eyes were of Oriental descent, were tinged less
or more with fairer hues in crossing West. People of
sandy hair and florid complexions were of Northern
ancestry. The fusion of the various races was now
taking place, blending all, doubtless, into a more harmonious
and beautiful type.</p>

<p>He asked if there did not lurk in the fancy, if not in
our atoms, a persuasion that complexion, like features,
voice, gait, typified and emblazoned personal traits of
their possessors, if the rhetoric of morals and religion
did not revel in like distinctions. "Handsome is that
handsome does." Beauty was the birthright of all, if
not their inheritance. It was shame that brought deformity
into the world. Every child accused, he
knew not whom, for any blemish of his. "Why not
mine the happy star, too?" Still some trait was insinuated
into the least favored, and stamped upon the
embryonic clay. Ebony, alabaster, indigo, vermilion,
the pigments were all mingled as purity or passion
decreed. Types were persistent, family features standing
strong for centuries and perpetuating themselves
from generation to generation. Place the portraits of a
long line of ancestors on the walls, one's features were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
all there, with the slight variations arising from intermarriage,
degrees of culture, calling, climate.</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>"Our faces were our coats of arms."</p>
</div></div>

<p>"Eyes were most characteristic. These played the
prime parts in life,&mdash;eyes and voice. Eyes were a
civility and a kingdom: voice a fortune. There was a
culture, a fate in them, direful, divine." And he
quoted, without naming the author:&mdash;</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>"Black eyes, in your dark orbs doth lie</p>
<p class='verse'>My ill or happy destiny;</p>
<p class='verse'>If with clear looks you me behold,</p>
<p class='verse'>You give me wine and mounts of gold;</p>
<p class='verse'>If you dart forth disdainful rays,</p>
<p class='verse'>To your own dye you turn my days;</p>
<p class='verse'>Black eyes, in your dark orbs doth dwell</p>
<p class='verse'>My bane or bliss, my heaven or hell."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Then added, significantly:&mdash;</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>Ask you <em>my</em> preference, what their hue?</p>
<p class='verse'>Surely the safe, celestial blue.</p>
</div></div>

<p>He said: "Voice classified us. The harmonious
voice tells of the harmonious soul. Millions of fiends
are evoked in a breath by an irritated one. A gentle
voice converts the Furies into Muses. The highest
saint is not he who strives the most violently, but he
upon whom goodness sits gracefully, whose strength is
gentleness, duty loved, because spontaneous, and who
wastes none of his power in effort; his will being one
and above temptation. True love says, 'Come to my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
embrace, you are safer with me than you were with
yourself, since I am wise above knowledge, and tasting
of the apple.' The sequel is bliss and peace. But after
fascination comes sorrow, remorse. The touch of the
demonized soul is poison. Read Swedenborg's Hells,
he added, and beware of demonized eyes!"</p>

<p>I never saw any one who seemed to purify words as
Mr.&nbsp;Alcott does; with him nothing is common or
unclean.</p>

<p>He then spoke of temperance in its widest sense, as
being that which contributed to health of the whole
being, body and soul alike. He said, "We should
breakfast on sunrise and sup on sunset." And he read
passages from Pythagoras, recommending music as a
diet. "Pythagoras composed melodies for the night and
morning, to purify the brain. He forbade his disciples
the using of flesh meats, or drinks which heated and
disturbed the brain, or hindered the music of dreams."</p>

<p>At this point of the conversation, Miss Bremer and
Mr.&nbsp;Benzon, the Swedish consul, came in, and there
was a slight pause.</p>

<p>Mr.&nbsp;Alcott then resumed the subject, and read
Emerson's Bacchus, to which he gave new significance.
When he had finished, he said, "This is the
wine we want." He then spoke of the subject proposed
for the evening's conversation, which was Enthusiasm,
defining it as "an abandonment to the instincts. The
seer," he said, "was one in whom memory predominated,
and many of his visions were recollections rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of a former than revelations of a future state." This
state of clairvoyance he named "thought a-bed, or philosophy
recumbent"; and in this view he spoke of
"Swedenborg, who was an enthusiast in the latter
sense, and revealed remarkable things." He quoted a
passage from Swedenborg's diary, wherein he speaks
of his being created with the power of breathing inwardly,
suspending his outward breathing, and in this
way conversed with angels and spirits.</p>

<p>Miss Bremer asked Mr.&nbsp;Alcott "if he called Swedenborg
an enthusiast."</p>

<p>Mr.&nbsp;Alcott said, "Swedenborg was in such fine relations
with nature and spirit, that many things seemed
revealed to him beyond the apprehension of ordinary
men. He was a seer rather of supernatural than of
spiritual things; a preternaturalist, rather than spiritualist.
He had wonderful insights into nature, also,
which science was almost every day confirming."</p>

<p>"His followers claimed that he anticipated important
discoveries, both in natural as in spiritual science, and
that his merits were enhanced by his claim to supernatural
illumination. And whatever his gifts, how assisted,
whether by agencies supernatural or preternatural, their
operations were of wonderful sweep, his insights surpassing,
transcending the comprehension of any successor;
of a kind that have led some to suspect that he
staggered down under the weight of his endowments.
Certainly, he stands, like Boehme, an exceptional mind,
in the order of nature, and awaits an interpreter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
to determine his place in the world of thought. He
is the most eminent example furnished in modern
biography of the possibilities of the metempsychosis,
as if we saw in him an ability to translate himself
at will, personally, wheresoever he would, taking his
residence for the while in plant, animal, mineral,
atom, with the superadded faculty of ravishing its
secret. Nor content with this, he ransacks the primeval
elements, the limbos of chaos and night. What
burglaries he perpetrates! picking of locks, slitting of
mysteries, opening rents into things sacred and profane,&mdash;of
these no end. Then such edifices rising
from regions of vagary and shadow, a goblin world,
grand, grotesque, seldom lighted from above, or
tipped with azure. His heavens had no prospects;
no perspective; his hells were lurid; the pit bottomless,
a Stygian realm throughout. His genius plunges,
seldom soars; is not fledged, but footed; his heaven but
the cope of the abyss in plain sight of the doomed.
His angels are spectral, unwholesome; his celestials
too knowing to be innocent.</p>

<p>"It were a fruitless task to follow him from starting-point
to goal, if goal there be, in his restless racing
throughout nature. The ghost-seer of shadow-land,
whereinto he smuggled all natural things as spiritual
phantoms; he needs be studied with due drawback
of doubt, as to the veracity of his claim to divine
illumination. Still with every abatement, here is a
body of truth none can gainsay nor resist; abysses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
not yet fathomed by any successor, naturalist, or
spiritualist."</p>

<p>After this surprising statement of his views of Swedenborg,
Miss Bremer asked more questions about Mr.
Alcott's definition of an Enthusiast, adding: "Christ,
then, if we speak of him as a man, was an enthusiast."</p>

<p>Mr.&nbsp;Alcott, smiling, said, "Yes, the divinest of enthusiasts,
surrendering himself entirely to the instincts
of the Spirit; might safely do so, being holy, whole,
inspired throughout all his gifts, his whole Personality,&mdash;the
divine fire pervaded every part; therefore he
was the celestial man."</p>

<p>The conversation here turned upon Nature, in some
way which I do not now recollect, and Mr.&nbsp;Alcott
spoke of the great mission of the prophet of nature.</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>"The public child of earth and sky."</p>
</div></div>

<p>"Nature," he said, "was more to some persons than
others; they standing in closer relations to it."</p>

<p>"But nature," said Miss Bremer, "is not wholly
good."</p>

<p>"No," said Mr.&nbsp;Alcott; "there is something of Fate
in her, too, as in some persons. She, too, is a little
bitten."</p>

<p>The expression seemed to amuse her, for she repeated
it several times, laughing.</p>

<p>Mr.&nbsp;Alcott then said, "that nature was not wholly
sane. It was given to the celestial man alone to take
from it only what was salutary, as it was the Nemesis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
of the demonic man to take what was hurtful. Bees
gathered honey from all flowers."</p>

<p>James Russell Lowell asked "if bees did not sometimes
secrete poisonous honey?"</p>

<p>Mr.&nbsp;Alcott said "he believed they did, but only when
wholesome flowers were denied them."</p>

<p>Miss Littlehale suggested that "honey was not poisonous
to the bees, but to men only, and Mr.&nbsp;Lowell
allowed that it was not."</p>

<p>Miss Bremer now returned to the word Enthusiast.
She said Mr.&nbsp;Alcott had defined it well as "divine
intoxication."</p>

<p>I do not follow the order of time in what follows, but
record some scattered sayings of the conversation.</p>

<p>Mr.&nbsp;Alcott spoke of "the celestial, or unfallen man,
as not making choice of good; he was chosen rather;
elected, deliberation presupposed a mixed will, a temptation
and a lapse. Then, opening Plotinus, he read
this beautiful passage:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Every soul is a Venus. And this, the nativity of
Venus, and Love who was born at the same time with
her, obscurely signify. The soul, therefore, when in
a condition conformable to nature, loves God, wishing
to be united to him, being, as it were, the desire of
a beautiful virgin to be conjoined with a beautiful
love. When, however, the soul descends into generation,
then being, as it were, deceived by spurious
nuptials, and associating herself with another and mortal
love, she becomes petulant and insolent, through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
being absent from her father. But when she again
hates wantonness and injustice, and becomes purified
from the defilements which are here, and again returns
to her father, she is affected in the most felicitous
manner. And those, indeed, who are ignorant of this
affection, may from worldly love form some conjecture
of divine love, by considering how great a felicity the
possession of a most beloved object is conceived to be;
and also, by considering that those earthly objects of
love are mortal and noxious; that the love of them is
nothing more than the love of images, and that they
lose their attractive power because they are not truly
desirable, nor our real good, nor that which we investigate.
In the ideal world, however, the object of love
is to be found, with which we may be conjoined, which
we may participate and truly possess, and which is not
externally enveloped with flesh. He, however, who
knows this, well knew what I say, and will be convinced
that the soul has another life."</p>

<p>Miss Bremer seemed puzzled by this reading as
questioning in her mind a distinction between virtue
and innocence, or holiness, which Mr.&nbsp;Alcott had discriminated
clearly.</p>

<p>Some one inquired, "How can we trust our instincts
since these have been so differently educated?"</p>

<p>Mr.&nbsp;Alcott said "they had rather been overborne by
the appetites and passions. It was the tragedy of life
that these were obscured so soon, and the mind left in
confusion. The child was more of an enthusiast than
the man ordinarily. And then so many were born old;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
even in the babe one sometimes sees some ancient sinner.
Youth is so attractive because still under the
sway of instinct. The highest duty is musical and
sings itself. Business, lusts, draw men downwards.
Yet were life earnest and true to the instincts, it would
be music and song. Life was too much for most.
No one was always an enthusiast. It was in the
golden moments that he was filled with the overflowing
divinity. The blissful moments were those when one
abandons himself to the Spirit, letting it do what it will
with him. True, most persons were divided, there were
two or more of them,&mdash;a Deuce distracting them and
they in conflict with evils, or devils. But what is the
bad but lapse from the good,&mdash;the good blindfolded?"</p>

<p>"Ah! Mr.&nbsp;Alcott," said Miss Bremer, laughing, "I
am desperately afraid there is a little bit of a devil,
after all."</p>

<p>"One's foes are of his own household," said Mr.
Alcott. "If his house is haunted it is by himself only.
Our Choices were our Saviours or Satans."</p>

<p>Speaking of the temperaments, Mr.&nbsp;Alcott discriminated
these in their different elements.</p>

<p>The celestial man was composed more largely of light
and ether. The demonic man combined more of fire
and vapor. The animal man more of embers and dust.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
The sacraments might be considered symbolically, as
Baptism, or purification by water.</p>

<p>Fasting, or temperance in outward delights.</p>

<p>Continence, or chastity in personal indulgences.</p>

<p>Prayer, or aspiring aims.</p>

<p>Labor, or prayer in act or pursuits.</p>

<p>These he considered the regimen of inspiration and
thought.</p>

<p>Mr.&nbsp;Alcott closed the conversation by reading from
the Paradise Regained a description of the banquet
spread by Satan for Christ; also, the lines in praise
of Chastity, from the Comus, whose clear statue-like
beauty always affects one powerfully.</p>

<h3><a name="HAWTHORNE" id="HAWTHORNE">HAWTHORNE.</a></h3>

<p class='align-right-indent'><span class="smcap">Monday, 19.</span></p>

<p>Hawthorne was of the darker temperament and
tendencies. His sensitiveness and sadness were
native, and he cultivated them apparently alike by solitude,
the pursuits and studies in which he indulged, till
he became almost fated to know gayer hours only by
stealth. By disposition friendly, he seemed the victim of
his temperament, as if he sought distance, if not his pen,
to put himself in communication, and possible sympathy
with others,&mdash;with his nearest friends, even. His reserve
and imprisonment were more distant and close, while
the desire for conversation was livelier, than any one I
have known. There was something of strangeness even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
in his cherished intimacies, as if he set himself afar
from all and from himself with the rest; the most diffident
of men, as coy as a maiden, he could only be won
by some cunning artifice, his reserve was so habitual, his
isolation so entire, the solitude so vast. How distant
people were from him, the world they lived in, how
he came to know so much about them, by what
stratagem he got into his own house or left it,
was a marvel. Fancy fixed, he was not to be jostled
from himself for a moment, his mood was so persistent.
There he was in the twilight, there he stayed. Was he
some damsel imprisoned in that manly form pleading
alway for release, sighing for the freedom and companionships
denied her? Or was he some Assyrian ill at ease
afar from the olives and the East? Had he strayed
over with William the Conqueror, and true to his Norman
nature, was the baron still in republican America,
secure in his castle, secure in his tower, whence he could
defy all invasion of curious eyes? What neighbor of
his ever caught him on the highway, or ventured to
approach his threshold?</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>"His bolted Castle gates, what man should ope,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Unless the Lord did will</p>

<p class='verse'>And tempt the fates hid in his horoscope?"</p>
</div></div>

<p>Yet if by chance admitted, welcome in a voice that a
woman might own for its hesitancy and tenderness; his
eyes telling the rest.</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>"For such the noble language of his eye,</p>
<p class='verse'>That when of words his lips were destitute,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Your intrusion was worth the courage it cost; it emboldened
to future assaults to carry this fort of bashfulness.
During all the time he lived near me, our estates
being separated only by a gate and shaded avenue, I
seldom caught sight of him; and when I did it was but
to lose it the moment he suspected he was visible;
oftenest seen on his hill-top screened behind the shrubbery
and disappearing like a hare into the bush when
surprised. I remember of his being in my house but
twice, and then he was so ill at ease that he found excuse
for leaving politely forthwith,&mdash;"the stove was so hot,"
"the clock ticked so loud." Yet he once complained
to me of his wish to meet oftener, and dwelt on the
delights of fellowship, regretting he had so little. I
think he seldom dined from home; nor did he often
entertain any one,&mdash;once, an Englishman, when I
was also his guest; but he preserved his shrinking
taciturnity, and left to us the conversation. Another
time I dined with a Southern guest at his table. The
conversation turning on the war after dinner, he hid
himself in the corner, as if a distant spectator, and
fearing there was danger even there. It was due to his
guest to hear the human side of the question of slavery,
since she had heard only the best the South had to
plead in its favor.</p>

<p>I never deemed Hawthorne an advocate of Southern
ideas and institutions. He professed democracy, not in
the party, but large sense of equality. Perhaps he loved
England too well to be quite just to his native land,&mdash;was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
more the Old Englishman than the New. He
seemed to regret the transplanting, as if reluctant to
fix his roots in our soil. His book on England,
entitled "Our Old Home," intimates his filial affection
for that and its institutions. If his themes were
American, his treatment of them was foreign, rather. He
stood apart as having no stake in home affairs. While
calling himself a democrat, he sympathized apparently
with the absolutism of the old countries. He had not
full faith in the people; perhaps feared republicanism
because it had. Of our literary men, he least sympathized
with the North, and was tremulously disturbed, I
remember, at the time of the New-York mob. It is
doubtful if he ever attended a political meeting or
voted on any occasion throughout the long struggle
with slavery. He stood aloof, hesitating to take a responsible
part, true to his convictions, doubtless,
strictly honest, if not patriotic.</p>

<p>He strove by disposition to be sunny and genial,
traits not native to him. Constitutionally shy, recluse,
melancholy, only by shafts of wit and flow of humor
could he deliver himself. There was a soft sadness
in his smile, a reserve in his glance, telling how isolate
he was. Was he ever one of his company while in it?
There was an aloofness, a <em>besides</em>, that refused to affiliate
himself with himself, even. His readers must feel
this, while unable to account for it, perhaps, or express
it adequately. A believer in transmitted traits needs
but read his pedigree to find the genesis of what characterized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
him distinctly, and made him and his writings
their inevitable sequel. Everywhere you will find persons
of his type and complexion similar in cast of
character and opinions. His associates mostly confirm
the observation.</p>

<h4>LANDOR.</h4>

<p>Landor's Biography, edited by James Forster, and
lately published here, well repays perusal. Landor
seems to have been the victim of his temperament all
his life long. I know not when I have read a commentary
so appalling on the fate that breaks a noble
mind on the wheel of its passions, precipitating it into
the dungeons but to brighten its lights. Of impetuous
wing, his genius was yet sure of its boldest flights, and
to him, if any modern, may be applied Coleridge's
epithet of "myriad mindedness," so salient, varied,
so daring the sweep of his thought. More than any he
reminds of Shakespeare in dramatic power; of Plato,
in his mastery of dialogue; in epic force, of &AElig;schylus.
He seems to have been one of the demigods, cast down,
out of place, out of his time, restless ever, and indignant
at his destiny,&mdash;</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>"Heaven's exile straying from the orb of light."</p>
</div></div>

<p>His stormful, wayward career exemplifies in a remarkable
manner the recoiling Fate pervading human
affairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
"A sharp dogmatic man," says Emerson, who met
him when abroad, "with a great deal of knowledge, a
great deal of worth and a great deal of pride, with a
profound contempt for all that he does not understand,
a master of elegant learning and capable of the utmost
delicacy of sentiment, and yet prone to indulge a sort
of ostentation of coarse imagery and language. He
has capital enough to have furnished the brain of fifty
stock authors, yet has written no good book. In these
busy days of avarice and ambition, when there is so little
disposition to profound thought, or to any but the most
superficial intellectual entertainments, a faithful scholar,
receiving from past ages the treasures of wit, and enlarging
them by his own lore, is a friend and consoler
of mankind. Whoever writes for the love of mirth and
beauty, and not with ulterior ends, belongs to this
sacred class, and among these, few men of the present
age have a better claim to be numbered than Mr.&nbsp;Landor.
Wherever genius and taste have existed, wherever
freedom and justice are threatened (which he values as
the element in which genius may work), his interest is
here to be commanded. Nay, when we remember his
rich and ample page, wherein we are always sure to find
free and sustained thought, a keen and precise understanding,
an affluent and ready memory familiar with
all chosen books, an industrious observation in every
department of life, an experience to which nothing has
occurred in vain, honor for every just sentiment, and a
scourge like that of the Furies for every oppressor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
whether public or private, we feel how dignified is this
perpetual censor in his cerule chair, and we wish to
thank a benefactor of the reading world."</p>

<p>No writer of our time in the difficult species of composition,
the dialogue, has attained a success upon so
high a plane as Landor in his Conversations, wherein
he has treated almost every human interest, brought his
characters together, like Plato's interlocutors, from
different ages and of differing opinions, using these as
representatives of the world's best literature. And besides
these his masterpieces, his verses have the chaste
and exquisite quality of the best Greek poetry.</p>

<p>"His dialogues number," says his biographer, "not
fewer than a hundred and fifty. Different as these were
in themselves, it was not the less the distinguishing
mark of their genius to be, both in their conformation
and in their mass, almost strangely alike; and it is this
unity in their astonishing variety, the fire of an inexpressible
genius running through the whole, that
gives to his books containing them their place among
the books not likely to pass away; there is scarcely a form
or function of the human mind, sincere or sprightly,
cogitative or imaginative, historical, fanciful, or real,
which has not been exercised or brought into play in
this extraordinary series of writings. The world, past
and present, is reproduced in them, with its variety and
uniformity, its continuity and change."</p>

<p>What Landor says of written dialogue, holds in still
wider latitude, even, in conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
"When a man writes a dialogue, he has it all to himself,
the pro and the con, the argument and the reply.
Within the shortest given space of time, he may indulge
in every possible variety of mood. He may contradict
himself every minute. In the same page, without any
sort of violence, the most different shades of sentiment
may find expression. Extravagance of statement,
which in other forms could not be admitted, may be
fully put forth. Dogmas of every description may be
dealt in, audaciously propounded, or passionately opposed,
with a result all the livelier in proportion to the
mere vehemence expended on them. In no other style
of composition is a writer so free from ordinary restraints
upon opinion, or so absolved from self-control.
Better far than any other, it adapts itself to eagerness
and impatience. Dispensing with preliminaries, the
jump <i xml:lang='la' lang='la'>in medias res</i> may at once be taken safely. That
one thing should be unexpectedly laid aside, and another
as capriciously taken up, is quite natural to it;
the subjects being few that may not permissively branch
off into all the kindred topics connected with them,
when the formalities held ordinarily necessary in the
higher order of prose composition have disappeared in
the freedom of conversation."</p>

<p>Things admirable for the admirable hours. The
morning for thought, the afternoon for recreation,
the evening for company, the night for rest. Having
drank of immortality all night, the genius enters eagerly
upon the day's task, impatient of any impertinences
jogging the full glass. The best comes when we
are at our best; and who so buoyant as to be always
rider of the wave? Sleep, and see; wake, and report
the nocturnal spectacle. Sleep, like travel, enriches,
refreshes, by varying the day's perspective, showing us
the night side of the globe we traverse day by day.
We make transits too swift for our wakeful senses to
follow; pass from solar to lunar consciousness in a
twinkling, lapse from forehead and face to occupy our
lower parts, and recover, as far as permitted, the keys
of genesis and of the foreworlds. "All truth," says
Porphyry, "is latent; but this the soul sometimes beholds
when she is a little liberated by sleep from the
employments of the body. And sometimes she extends
her sight, but never perfectly reaches the objects of her
vision. Hence, when she beholds, she does not see it
with a free and direct light, but through an intervening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
veil, which the folds of darkening nature draw over her
eye. This veil, when in sleep it admits the light to extend
as far as truth, is said to be of horn, whose nature
is such, from its tenuity, that it is pervious to the light.
But when it dulls the sight and repels its vision of
truth, it is said to be of ivory, which is a body so naturally
dense, that, however thin it may be scraped, it
cannot be penetrated by the visual rays."</p>

divinely. Our dreams are characteristic of our waking
thoughts and states; we are never out of character;
never quite another, even when fancy seeks to metamorphose
us entirely. The Person is One in all the
manifold phases of the Many through which we transmigrate,
and we find ourself perpetually, because we
cannot lose ourself personally in the mazes of the many.

<p>"I catch myself philosophizing most eloquently,"
wrote Thoreau, "when first returning to consciousness

asleep, and mind works like a machine without friction.
I was conscious of having in my sleep transcended the
limits of the individual, and made observations and
carried on conversations which in my waking hours I
can neither recall nor appreciate. As if, in sleep, our
individual fell into the infinite mind, and at the moment
of awakening we found ourselves on the confines of the
latter. On awakening, we resume our enterprise, take
up our bodies, and become limited minds again. We
meet and converse with those bodies which we have
previously animated. There is a moment in the dawn
when the darkness of the night is dissipated, and before
the exhalations of the day begin to rise, when we see
all things more truly than at any other time. The light
is more trustworthy, since our senses are pure and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
atmosphere is less gross. By afternoon, all objects are
seen in mirage."</p>

<p>All men are spiritualists in finer or coarser manners,
as temperament and teaching dictate and determine,&mdash;the
spiritual world revealing itself accordingly. Speculation
has in all ages delighted itself in this preternatural
realm from whence have risen the ghosts of
realties too unsubstantial and fugitive for ordinary
senses to apprehend. Whatever the facts, they
receive interpretation according to the spirit and
intelligence of the believer. The past is full of such
prodigies and phenomena, for whose solution all learning,
sacred and profane, is revived in its turn. It
appears that like opinions have their rounds to run, like
theories with their disciples, reappearing in all great
crises of thought, and reaching a fuller solution at each
succeeding period. A faith, were such possible, destitute
of an element of preternaturalism, or of mysticism, pure
or mixed, could not gain general acceptance. Some
hold on the invisible connects the known with unknown,
yet leaving the copula to be divined. We define it on
our lips when we pronounce the word Person, and so
approach, as near as we may, to the "I Am" of things.</p>

<p>"Before the Revolution of 1688," says Coleridge,
"metaphysics ruled without experimental philosophy.
Since the Revolution, experimental psychology
has in like manner prevailed, and we now feel the
result. In like manner, from Plotinus to Proclus, that
is, from A.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;250 to A.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;450, philosophy was set up
as a substitute for religion; during the dark ages,
religion superseded philosophy, and the consequences
are equally instructive."</p>

<p>"The great maxim in legislation, intellectual or
physical, is <em>subordinate, not exclude</em>. Nature, in her
ascent, leaves nothing behind; but at each step subordinates
and glorifies,&mdash;mass, crystal, organ, sensation,
sentience, reflection."</p>

<p>Taken in reverse order of descent, Spirit puts itself
before, at each step protrudes faculty in feature, function,
organ, limb, subordinating to glorify also,&mdash;person,
volition, thought, sensibility, sense, body,&mdash;animating
thus and rounding creation to soul and sense
alike. The naturalist cannot urge too strongly the
claims of physical, nor the plea of the idealist be too
vigorously pressed for metaphysical studies. One body
in one soul. Nature and spirit are inseparable, and are
best studied as a unit. "Either without the other,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
as Plato said of sex, "is but half itself." Nature ends
where spirit begins. The idealist's point of view is
the obverse of the naturalist's, and each must accost
his side with a first love, before use has worn off the
bloom and seduced their vision.</p>

<p>Goethe said of Aristotle that "he had better observed
nature than any modern, but was too rash in his inferences
and conclusions"; and he adds, "we must go to
work slowly, and more indulgently with Nature, if we
would get anything from her."</p>

<p>Inspired by his example of dealing thus reverently
and lovingly with nature, the great naturalists of our
time are reading secrets hitherto hidden from less careful
and pious observers. If the results thus far have
not satisfied the idealist, it becomes him to consider
that his methods are the reverse of theirs, and that
when they shall have tracked Life in its manifold shapes
and modes of working in nature up to Spirit, their office
is fulfilled, their work complete, and their discoveries
are passed over to him for a higher generalization and
genesis. "A physical delineation of nature," says
Humboldt, "terminates at the point where the sphere
of intellect begins, and a new world is opened to our
view; it marks the limit, but does not pass it."</p>

<p>Whether man be the successor or predecessor of his
inferiors in nature, is to be determined by exploring
faithfully the realms of matter and of spirit alike, and
complementing the former in the latter. Whether surveyed
in order descending or ascending, in genesis or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
process, from the side of the idealist or of the naturalist,
the keystone of the arch in either case is an
ideal, underpropped by matter or upheld by mind.</p>

<p>Man, the sum total of animals, transcends all in
being a Person, a responsible creature. "The distinguishing
mark," says Aristotle, "between man and
the lower animals is this: that he alone is endowed with
the power of knowing good and evil, justice and injustice,
and it is a participation in this that constitutes a
family and a city." Man is man in virtue of being a
Person, a self-determining will, held accountable to
a spiritual Ideal. To affirm that brute creatures are
endowed with freedom and choice, the sense of responsibility,
were to exalt them into a spiritual existence
and personality; whereas, it is plain enough that they
are not above deliberation and choice, but below it,
under the sway of Fate, as men are when running
counter to reason and conscience. The will bridges
the chasm between man and brute, and frees the fated
creature he were else. Solitary, not himself, the
victim of appetite, inmate of the den, is man till freed
from individualism, and delivered into his free Personality.
"Ye must be born again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
The conflict between man's desires and satisfactions
declares his defection from Personal holiness. While
at one personally with himself, life suffices, his wants
are seconded as they rise, and his self-respect preserved
inviolate. But lapsed from personal rectitude, fallen
out of and below himself, he is at variance with things
around as within, his senses deceive, his will is divided,
and he becomes the victim of duplicities, discontents,
the prey of remorse.</p>

<p>"'Tis a miserable thing," says Glanvil, "to have
been happy; and a self-contented wretchedness is a
double one. Had felicity always been a stranger to
humanity, our present misery had not been. And had
not ourselves been the authors of our ruin, less. We
might have been made unhappy; but since we are miserable,
we chose it. He that gave our outward enjoyments
might have taken them from us, but none could
have robbed us of innocence but ourselves. While man
knows no sin, he is ignorant of nothing that it imports
humanity to know; but when he has sinned, the
same transgression that opens his eyes to see his own
shame, shuts them against most things else but that, and
the newly-purchased misery. With the nakedness of
his body, he sees that of his soul, and the blindness
and disarray of his faculties to which his former innocence
was a stranger; and that which shows them
to him makes them. No longer the creature he was
made, he loses not only his Maker's image, but his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
own. And does not much more transcend the creatures
placed at his feet, than he comes short of his ancient
self."</p>

<h3 class='p4'><a name="PLATOS_LETTERS" id="PLATOS_LETTERS">PLATO'S LETTERS.</a></h3>

<p class='align-right-indent'><span class="smcap">Tuesday, 3.</span></p>

<p>Days like these give dignity and loveliness to the
landscape; the scene enhanced by imperial tints
of gold and purple, the orchards bending with their
ruddy burdens. It is the season of nectar and ambrosia,
and suggests the Platonic bees, the literature
and conversation of the Academy and Lyceum.</p>

<p>Very interesting reading these letters of Plato, and
a goodly volume to hold in one's hand, in antique type
and binding. Whether a reprint would reward the publisher,
I cannot say. His seventh letter is an affecting
piece of autobiography, and, taken with Plutarch's Dion,
gives the best picture of his journeys to Syracuse that
history affords.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"For it is a thing," he writes to the Kindred and
Friends of Dion, "altogether correct and honorable
for him who aspires after things the most honorable,
both to himself and his country, to suffer whatever he
may suffer; for not one of us is naturally immortal; nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
if this should happen to any one would he become
happy, as it seems he would to the multitude. For in
things inanimate there is nothing either good or evil
worthy of mention, but good or ill will happen to each
soul, either existing with the body, or separated from it.
But it is ever requisite to trust really to the sacred accounts
of the olden times, which inform us that the soul
is immortal, and has judges of its conduct, and suffers
the greatest punishments when liberated from the body.
Hence, it is requisite to think it is a lesser evil to
suffer, than to commit the greatest sins and injuries."</p>

<p class='center'>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;</p>

<p>"And I should have felt more justly against those
who murdered Dion, an anger, in a certain manner,
almost as great as against Dionysius; for both had
injured myself and all the rest, so to say, in the highest
degree. For the former had destroyed a man who was
willing to make use of justice; while the latter was
unwilling to make use of it through the whole of his
dominions, although possessing the highest power. In
which dominions had philosophy and power existed
really, as it were, in the same dwelling, they would
have set up amongst men, both Greeks and barbarians,
an opinion not vainly shining, and in every respect the
true one, that neither a state nor a man can ever be
happy unless by leading a life with prudence in subjection
to justice, whether possessing those things themselves,
or by being brought up in the habits of holy
persons, their rulers, or instructed in justice."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
"This injury did Dionysius inflict. But the rest would
have been a trifling wrong as compared to these. But
he who murdered Dion did not know that he had done
the same deed as Dionysius. For I clearly know, as
far as possible for one man to speak confidently of another,
that if Dion had attained power, he would never
have changed it to any other form of government than
to that by which he first caused Syracuse, his own
country, after he had delivered it from slavery, to look
joyous, and had put it into the garb of freedom; and
after all this, he would by every contrivance have
adorned the citizens with laws both befitting and best;
and he would have been ready to do what followed in
due order after this, and have colonized the whole of
Sicily, and have freed it from the barbarians, by expelling
some and subduing others, more easily than
Hiero did. But if these things had taken place through
a man just, brave, and temperate, and who was a philosopher,
the same opinion of virtue would have been
produced amongst the multitude, as would have been
amongst all men, so to say, and have saved Dionysius,
had he been persuaded by me. But now some d&aelig;mon,
surely, or some evil spirit, falling upon with iniquity
and impiety, and what is the greatest matter, with the
audacity of ignorance, in which all evils are rooted,
and from which they spring up, and afterwards produce
fruit the most bitter to those who have begotten
it,&mdash;this has a second time subverted and destroyed
everything. However, let us, for the sake of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
good augury, keep for the third time a well-omened
silence."<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class='fnanchor'>15</a></p>

<p>One sees the noble spirit of Plato in these passages,
and feels how the death of his friend and pupil, Dion,
at the moment when he had won the freedom of his
country, and a sphere for proving his master's ideas in
its rule, must have affected Plato, and the friends of
Dion. If doubts have been entertained as to the genuineness
of these letters, it is plain they were written
by some intimate friend of his, or of Dion, and have
the merit, at least, of historical accuracy and evidence.</p>

<h4>PLATO.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class='fnanchor'>16</a></h4>

<p>It was a common speech among the Athenians, that
Apollo begat &AElig;sculapius and Plato,&mdash;the one to cure
bodies, the other, souls. Certainly the last was of divine
extraction; his life and thoughts fruitful in genius
and immortality. Like other superior persons, his birth
is traced to a divine ancestry, and dignified with fables.
His mother, Perictione, was a descendant of Solon, and
a woman of extraordinary beauty. Aristo, his father,
was of an eminent family. To him Apollo appeared in
a dream, enjoining upon him respect for his wife's
maternity; and, in accordance with the vision, it was
affirmed,&mdash;</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>"He did not issue from a mortal bed;</p>
<p class='verse'>A god his sire, a godlike life he led."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Whilst he was yet an infant, carried in his mother's
arms, Aristo went to Hymettus to sacrifice to the
Muses, taking his wife and child with him. As they
were busied in the divine rites, she laid the babe in a
thicket of myrtles hard by, to whom, as he slept, came
a swarm of bees, artists of Hymettian honey, flying and
buzzing about him, and (so runs the myth) made a
honeycomb in his mouth,&mdash;this being a presage of the
singular sweetness of his future eloquence foreseen in
infancy.</p>

<p>As things fall out, not by chance, but by divine ordination,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and are intimated in advance, for the most part,
so Socrates, who was to win the noblest of the Athenian
youths for his pupil and disciple, dreamed, the night
before Plato was commended to him, that a young swan
fled from Cupid's altar in the Academy, and sat upon
his lap, thence flew up to heaven, delighting both gods
and men with its music. Next day, as he was relating
this to some of his friends, Aristo came to him, and
presented his son Plato to be his pupil. As soon as
Socrates saw him, reading in his looks his ingenuity,
"Friends," said he, "this is the swan of Cupid's
Academy."</p>

<p>Whilst a child, he was remarkable for his sharpness
of apprehension, and the admirable modesty of his disposition;
the beginnings of his youth being seasoned
with labor and love of study, which virtues increased
and harmonized with all others when he came to man's
estate. He early learned the art of wrestling, and
became so great a proficient that he took part in the
Isthmian and Pythian games. As in years and virtue,
so likewise he increased extraordinarily in bodily proportion
and shape, insomuch that Aristo named him
Plato, which implies breadth of shoulders and bold eloquence.
He also studied painting and poetry, writing
epics after the manner of Homer; but, finding how far
he fell short of him, he committed them to the flames.
Intending to contest for the palm at the Olympic Theatre,
he wrote some dramatic pieces, and gave them to
the players, to be performed at the festivals. But the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
day before these were to have been presented, chancing
to hear Socrates discourse in the theatre before the
Bacchanals, he was so taken with him that he not only
forbore to contest at the time, but wholly gave over all
tragic poetry, and burned his verses. From that time,
being then in his twentieth year, he became a follower
of Socrates, and studied philosophy.</p>

<p>He studied eight years with Socrates, committing, as
was the custom with his scholars, the substance of his
master's discourses to writing. Of these were some of
his Dialogues afterwards composed, with such additions
of argument and ornament that Socrates, hearing him
recite his Lysis, exclaimed, "O Hercules! how many
things this young man fables of me!"</p>

<p>He was one of the youngest of the Senate at the
time of Socrates' arraignment. The judges being much
displeased with Socrates, Plato took the orator's chair,
intending to plead in his master's defence, beginning,
"Though I, Athenians, am the youngest of those that
come to this place,"&mdash;but, as all the Senate were
against his speaking, he was constrained to leave the
chair. Socrates being condemned, Plato offered to
obtain the money for purchasing his liberty, which
Socrates refused. Upon the death of Socrates, Plato,&mdash;whose
excessive grief is mentioned by Plutarch,&mdash;with
others of his disciples, fearing the tyranny of
those who put their master to death, fled to Euclid at
Megara, who befriended and entertained them till the
storm was blown over. He afterwards travelled in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Italy, where he addicted himself to the discipline of
Pythagoras, which, though he saw it replenished with
curious and high reason, yet he chiefly affected the continence
and chastity, along with the knowledge of
nature, possessed by that school.</p>

<p>Desiring to add to the knowledge of the Pythagoreans
the benefits of other disciplines, he went to Cyrene
to learn geometry of Theodorus, the mathematician;
thence into Egypt, under pretence of selling oil,&mdash;the
scope of his journey thither being to bring the knowledge
of astrology from thence, and to be instructed in
the rites of the prophets and the mysteries. Having
taken a full survey of the country, he settled himself
at Sais, learning of the school of wise men there the
doctrines of the universe, the immortality of the soul,
and its transmigrations. From Egypt he returned to
Tarentum in Italy, where he conversed with Archytas
the elder, and other Pythagoreans, adding to the learning
of Socrates that of Pythagoras. He would have
gone also to India to study with the Magi; but the wars
then raging in Asia prevented. While in Egypt he
probably became familiar with the opinions of Hermes
Trismegistus. That he also received some light from
Moses is probable, since his laws were translated into
Greek before Alexander's time, and Josephus, the Jew,
affirms, "that he chiefly followed our Lawgiver." And
Numenius asks, "Of philosophers, what is Plato but
Moses speaking Greek?" It is known that he brought
from Sicily, where he went thrice, at the invitation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Dionysius the younger, the three books of Philolaus,
the Pythagorean, on natural philosophy, the first that
were published out of that school. These he appears
to have woven into his dialogue entitled "Timeus."
Timeon accuses him of this appropriation.</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>"You Plato with the same affection caught</p>
<p class='verse'>With a great sum, a little treatise bought,</p>
<p class='verse'>Where all the knowledge which you own was taught,"&mdash;</p>
</div></div>

<p class='no-indent'>alluding to his having received of Dionysius above
eighty talents, and being flush with his money.</p>

<p>He is said to owe much to Protagoras, and wrote a
dialogue under that title. In politics, as in morals, he
drew largely from the opinions of his master, Socrates;
and it is related that he was indebted to the books of
Sophron, which, having been long neglected, were by
him first brought to Athens, and found under his pillow
at his death. Certainly he, of all scholars, had the best
right to borrow, since none could recognize his own in
his pages, and any author might glory in being esteemed
worthy of lending a syllable to so consummate a creator.</p>

<p>On returning to Athens from his Egyptian travels,
he settled himself in the Academy, a gymnasium, or
place of exercise, in the suburbs of the city, surrounded
by woods, and taking its name from Academus, one of
the heroes.</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>"The fluent, sweet-tongued sage first led the way,</p>
<p class='verse'>Who writes as smoothly as from some green spray</p>
<p class='verse'>Of Academe grasshoppers chirp their lay."</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
The occasion of his living here was that he owned an
orchard adjoining the Academy. In process of time,
this orchard was much enlarged by good-will, studious
persons bequeathing of their riches to the professors of
philosophy, to maintain the quiet and tranquillity of a
philosophical life. Here he first taught philosophy;
afterwards in the Gardens of Colonus. At the entrance
of his school was written,&mdash;</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>"Let none ignorant of geometry enter here";</p>
</div></div>

<p class='no-indent'>signifying, by this inscription, not only the proportion
and harmony of lines, but also of inward affections and
ideas.</p>

<p>His school took the name of the Academy. He
thought it was a great matter, in the education of
youth, to accustom them to take delight in good things;
otherwise, he affirmed, pleasures were the bait of evil.
Education should be conducted with a serene sweetness,
never by force or violence, but by gentleness, accompanied
with persuasion and every kind of invitation.
His teaching was conducted by conversation or dialogue.
His method of discourse was threefold,&mdash;first,
to declare what that is which is taught; then, for what
reason it is asserted, whether as a principal cause, or
as a comparison, and whether to defend the tenet, or
controvert it; thirdly, whether it be rightly said. He
expounded the things which he conceived to be true;
confuted those which were false; suspended his opinions
on those which were doubtful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
His philosophy comprised the elements of the school
of Heraclitus, Pythagoras, and Socrates, combined in a
system which he distributed into three parts,&mdash;moral,
consisting of action; natural, in contemplation; rational,
in distinction of true and false, which, though
useful in all, yet belongs to pure thought. As of old,
in a tragedy the chorus acted alone; then Thespis,
making some intermissions of the chorus, introduced
one actor, &AElig;schylus a second, Sophocles a third; in
like manner, philosophy was at first but of one kind,&mdash;physic;
then Socrates added ethic; thirdly, Plato,
inventing dialectic, made it perfect.</p>

<p>This third part, dialectic, consisting in reason and
dissertation, he treated thus: Though judgments arise
from the sense, yet the judgment of truth is not in the
senses. The mind alone is the judge of things, and
only fit to be credited, because the mind alone sees that
which is simple, uniform, and certain, which is named
Idea. All sense he conceived to be obtuse and slow,
and nowise able to perceive those things which seem
subject to sense; those things being so minute that
they cannot fall under sense; so movable and various,
that nothing is one, constant and the same; all are in
continual alteration and movement, and subjects of
opinion only. Science he affirmed to be nowhere but
in the reasons and thoughts of the mind, whose objects
are ideas, whence he approved definitions of things,
and applied these to whatsoever subject he discussed,
discriminating things and naming them etymologically.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
In this consisted the discipline of dialectic; that is, of
speech concluded by reason. Though Socrates practised
conversation by way of question and answer, or
dialogue, yet Plato so much refined the form, both in
speech and composition, that he deserves to be preferred
before others, as well for invention as reformation. The
analytical method, which reduces the thing sought into
its principle, is his invention.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class='fnanchor'>17</a></p>

<p>Several words were also introduced by him in philosophy.
Of these are "element," which before his time
was confounded with "principle." He distinguished
them thus: "Principle is that which has nothing before
it whereof it might be generated; elements are compounded."
The word "poem" was first used by him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
So were "superficies" and "antipodes." "Divine
providence," words since appropriated by Christian
theologians, was first an expression of Plato's. He,
too, first considered the force and efficacy of grammar
as the organ of pure thought.</p>

<p>His school was the pride of Athens, and drew into it
its most gifted youth, as well as scholars from abroad.
His most distinguished disciples were Speusippus, his
nephew, whom he reformed by his example and teachings,
and who became eminent as a philosopher, succeeding
him in the Academy; Xenocrates, whom he
much loved; Aristotle, the Stagirite, whom Plato used
to call a wild colt, foreseeing that he would oppose him
in his philosophy, as a colt, having sucked, kicks its
dam. Xenocrates was slow, Aristotle quick, in extremity;
whence Plato said of them, "See what an
unequal team this of mine. What an ass and horse to
yoke together!"</p>

<p>Isocrates the orator, and Demosthenes, were among
his auditors; Dion of Syracuse was an intimate friend
of his, and by his persuasions he made two journeys to
Syracuse, at one of which he was sold into slavery by
the tyranny of Dionysius, and being redeemed by his
friend, returned to Athens, as is related by Plutarch.
Xenophon was his contemporary.</p>

<p>At home he lived quietly in the Academy, not taking
part in public affairs, the laws and customs of the
Athenians not being in harmony with his ideas of republican
institutions. "Princes," he said, "had no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
better possessions than the familiarity of such men as
could not flatter, wisdom being as necessary to a prince
as the soul to the body; and that kingdoms would be
most happy if either philosophers ruled, or the rulers
were inspired with philosophy, since nothing is more
pernicious than power and arrogance accompanied with
ignorance. Subjects should be such as princes seem to
be." And he held that a philosopher might retire from
the commonwealth if its affairs were unjustly administered.
"A just man was a perpetual magistrate."</p>

<p>He affirmed that philosophy was the true helper of
the soul, all else but ornamental; that nothing is more
pleasing to a sound mind than to speak and hear the
truth spoken, than which nothing is better or more
lasting.</p>

<p>The study of philosophy, if it made him select in the
choice of his associates, did not sour his temper, nor
render him exclusive in his intercourse and fellowship
with mankind. At the Olympian games, he once fell
into company with some strangers who did not know
him, upon whose affections he gained greatly by his
affable conversation, dining and spending the day with
them, never mentioning either the Academy or Socrates,
only saying his name was Plato. When they came to
Athens, he entertained them courteously. "Come,
Plato," said the strangers, "now show us your namesake,
Socrates' disciple. Take us to the Academy:
recommend us to him, that we may know him." He,
smiling a little, as he used, said, "I am the man."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Whereat they were greatly amazed, having conversed
so familiarly with a person of that eminence, who used
no boasting or ostentation, and showed that, besides his
philosophical discourse, his ordinary conversation was
extremely winning.</p>

<p>He lived single, yet soberly and chastely. So constant
was he in his composure and gravity, that a youth
brought up under him, returning to his parents, and
hearing his father speak vehemently and loudly, said,
"I never found this in Plato." He ate but once a day,
or, if the second time, very sparingly, abstaining mostly
from animal food. He slept alone, and much discommended
the contrary practice.</p>

<p>Of his prudence, patience, moderation, and magnanimity,
and other virtues, there are many instances
recorded. When he left his school, he was wont to say,
"See, youths, that you employ your idle hours usefully.
Prefer labor before idleness, unless you esteem rust
above brightness."</p>

<p>To Philedonus, who blamed him that he was as studious
to learn as teach, and asked him how long he
meant to be a disciple, he replied, "As long as I am
not ashamed of growing better and wiser."</p>

<p>Being asked what difference there was between a
learned man and unlearned,&mdash;"The same as betwixt
a physician and patient."</p>

<p>To Antisthenes, making a long oration,&mdash;"You forget
that discourse is to be measured by the hearer, not
the speaker."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Hearing a vicious person speak in defence of another,&mdash;"This
man," said he, "carries his heart in his
tongue." He blamed having musicians at feasts, "to
hinder discourse."</p>

<p>Seeing the Agregentines so magnificent in building,
and luxurious in feasting,&mdash;"These people," said he,
"build as if they were immortal, and eat as if they
were to die instantly."</p>

<p>He advised "drunken and angry men to look in the
glass if they would refrain from those vices," and
Xenocrates, by reason of his severe countenance, "to
sacrifice to the Graces."</p>

<p>Being desirous to wean Timotheus, the son of Canon,
the Athenian general, from sumptuous military feasts,
he invited him into the Academy to a plain moderate
supper, such as pleasing sleep succeeds in a good temper
of body. The next day, Timotheus, observing the
difference, said, "They who feasted with Plato never
complained the next morning."</p>

<p>His servant having displeased him for some offence,
he said to him, "Were I not angry, I should chastise
you for it." At another time, his servant being found
faulty, he had him lay off his coat; and, while he stood
with his hand raised, a friend coming in asked him
what he was doing. "Punishing an angry man," said
he. It was a saying of his, that "no wise man punishes
in respect of past faults, but for preventing future
ones."</p>

<p>On being told that some one spoke ill of him, he answered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
"No matter: I will live so that none shall
believe him." When asked whether there should be
any record left to posterity of his actions or sayings,&mdash;"First,"
said he, "we must get a name, then many
things follow."</p>

<p>Continuing a single life to his end, and not having
any heirs of his own, he bequeathed his estate to his
nephew, young Adimantus, the son of Adimantus, his
second brother. Besides his orchard and grounds inherited
or added by purchase, he left to him "three
mina of silver, a golden cup, and a finger and ear-rings
of gold. The gold ear-ring was one he wore when a
boy, as a badge of his nobility; and the golden cup
was one of sacrifice. He left to his servants, Ticho,
Bictus, and Apolloniades, Dionysius' goods." He
"owed no man anything."</p>

<p>He died on his eighty-first birthday, for which reason
the Magi at Athens sacrificed to him, as conceiving him
to have been more than man, and as having fulfilled the
most perfect number, nine multiplied into itself. He
died of old age; which Seneca ascribes to his temperance
and diligence.</p>

<p>This, among other epitaphs, was inscribed on his
tombstone:&mdash;</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>"Earth in her bosom Plato's body hides:</p>
<p class='verse'>His soul amongst the deathless gods resides.</p>
<p class='verse'>Aristo's son, whose fame to strangers spread,</p>
<p class='verse'>Made them admire the sacred life he led."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Plutarch tells that Solon began the story of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Atlantides, which he had learned of the priests of Sais,
but gave it over on account of his old age and the
largeness of the work. He adds that "Plato, taking
the same argument as a waste piece of fertile ground
fallen to him by hereditary right, manured, refined, and
inclosed it with large walls, porches, and galleries, such
as never any fable had before; but he too, undertaking
it late, died before completing it. 'The more things
written delight us, the more they disappoint us,' he remarks,
'when not finished.' For as the Athenian city
left the temple of Jupiter, so Plato's wisdom, amongst
many writings, left the Atlantides alone imperfect."</p>

<p>The order in which his dialogues were written is yet
a question of dispute with scholars. It is conceded,
however, that the "Republic" and the "Laws" were
completed, if not wholly written, in his old age. Nor
is the number of his dialogues accurately determined.
Some attributed to him are supposed to be spurious, as
are some of the letters. All are contained in Bohn's
edition of the works of Plato, and accessible in scholarly
translations to the English reader.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class='fnanchor'>18</a></p>

<p>Of the great minds of antiquity, Plato stands preeminent
in breadth and beauty of speculation. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
books are the most suggestive, sensible, the friendliest,
and, one may say, most modern of books. And it almost
atones for any poverty of thought in our time, this
admission to a mind thus opulent in the grandeur and
graces of intelligence, giving one a sense of his debt to
genius and letters. His works are a cosmos, as Pythagoras
named the world. And one rises from their
perusal as if returned from a circumnavigation of the
globe of knowledge, human and divine. So capacious
was his genius, so comprehensive, so inclusive, so subtile,
and so versatile, withal, that he readily absorbed
the learning of his time, moulding this into a body of
beauty and harmony compact; working out, with the
skill and completeness of a creator, the perfect whole
we see. His erudition was commensurate with his
genius, and he the sole master of his tools; since in
him we have an example, as successful as it was daring,
of an endeavor to animate and give individuality to his
age in the persons whose ideas gave birth to the age
itself. And fortunate it was for him, as for his readers,
that he had before him a living illustration of his time
in the person of the chief character in his dialogues,
Socrates himself.</p>

<p>Of these dialogues, the "Republic" is the most celebrated,
embodying his ripest knowledge. It fables a
city planted in the divine ideas of truth and justice
as these are symbolized in human forms and natural
things. And one reads with emotions of surprise at
finding so much of sense and wisdom embodied in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
form so fair, and of such wide application, as if it were
suited to all peoples and times. Where in philosophic
literature is found a structure of thought so firmly fixed
on natural foundations, and placing beyond cavil or
question the supremacy of mind over matter, portraying
so vividly the passage of ideas through the world,
and thus delivering down a divine order of society to
mankind?<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class='fnanchor'>19</a></p>

<p>In reading his works, one must have the secret of his
method. Written, as these are, in the simplest style
of composition, his reader may sometimes weary of the
slow progress of the argument, and lose himself in the
devious windings of the dialogue. But this is the sole
subtraction from the pleasure of perusal,&mdash;the voluminous
sacrifices thus made to method: so much given to
compliment, to dulness, in the interlinked threads of
the golden colloquy. Yet Plato rewards as none other;
his regal text is everywhere charged with lively sense,
flashing in every line, every epithet, episode, with the
rubies and pearls of universal wisdom. And the reading
is a coronation.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class='fnanchor'>20</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Plato's views of social life are instructive. His idea
of woman, of her place and function, should interest
women of our time. They might find much to admire,
and less to criticise than they imagine. His opinions
were greatly in advance of the practice of his own time,
and, in some important particulars, of ours, and which,
if carried into legislation, would favorably affect social
purity. His proposition to inflict a fine on bachelors,
and deny them political privileges, is a compliment to
marriage, showing in what estimate he held that relation.
So his provision for educating the children, and
giving women a place in the government of the republic,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
after they had given citizens to it, are hints of our modern
infant schools and woman's rights movements. His
teachings on social reform generally are the best of
studies, in some respects more modern than the views
of our time,&mdash;anticipating the future legislation of
communities. On the matter of race and temperament
he thought profoundly, comprehending as have few of
our naturalists the law of descent, complexions, physiognomical
features and characteristics.</p>

<h4>SOCRATES.</h4>

<p>"Socrates," says Grote, "disclaimed all pretensions to
wisdom. He announced himself as a philosopher, that
is, as ignorant, yet as painfully conscious of his ignorance
and anxiously searching for wisdom as a correction
to it, while most men were equally ignorant, but
unconscious of their ignorance, believed themselves to
be already wise, and delivered confident opinions without
ever having analyzed the matters on which they
spoke. The conversation of Socrates was intended,
not to teach wisdom, but to raise men out of this false
persuasion of wisdom, which he believed to be the
natural state of the human mind, into that mental condition
which he called philosophy.</p>

<p>"His 'Elenchus' made them conscious of their ignorance,
and anxious to escape from it, and prepared for
mental efforts in search of knowledge; in which search
Socrates assisted them, but without declaring, and even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
professing inability to declare, where the truth lay in
which this search was to end. He considered this
change itself a great and serious improvement, converting
what was evil, radical, ingrained, into evil superficial
and moveable, which was a preliminary condition
to any positive acquirement. The first thing to be done
was to create searchers after truth, men who look at
the subject for themselves, with earnest attention, and
make up their own individual convictions. Even if
nothing ulterior were achieved, that alone would be a
great deal.</p>

<p>"Such was the scope of the Socratic Conversation, and
such the conception of philosophy (the peculiarity which
Plato borrowed from Socrates), which is briefly noted
in the passage of the Lysis and developed in the Platonic
dialogues, especially in the Symposeum."</p>

<p>Observe how confidently the great master of Dialectic
went into the discussion, dealing directly all the while
with the Personality of his auditors, and driving straight
through the seeming windings of the discourse at the
seats of thought and of sensibility, by his searching
humor, his delightful irony, thus making the mind the
mind's guest and querist in his suggestive colloquy.
Affecting perhaps to know less than any, he yet showed
those with whom he conversed how little they knew,
while professing to know so much, convicting them of
being ignorant of their own ignorance, real wisdom beginning
in humility and openness to instruction. If
he puzzled and perplexed, it was but to reduce their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
egotism and ignorance, and prepare them for receiving
the truths he had to lay open in themselves. Plato,
Aristotle, the German Methodists, but define and deliver
the steps of his method.</p>

<h4>BERKELEY.</h4>

<p>Of modern philosophic writers, Berkeley has given
the best example of the Platonic Dialogue, in his
"Minute Philosopher," a book to be read with profit, for
its clearness of thought and method. His claim to the
name of metaphysician transcends those of most of his
countrymen. He, first of his nation, dealt face to face
with ideas as distinguished from scholastic fancies and
common notions, and thus gave them their place in the
order of mind; and this to exhaustive issues, as his
English predecessors in thought had failed to do. His
idealism is the purest which the British Isles have produced.
Platonic as were Cudworth, Norris, Henry More,
in cast of thought less scholastic than Taylor of Norwich,&mdash;who
was an exotic, rather, transplanted from
Alexandrian gardens,&mdash;Berkeley's thinking is indigenous,
strong in native sense and active manliness. His
works are magazines of rare and admirable learning,
subtleties of speculation, noble philanthropies. They
deserve a place in every scholar's library, were it but to
mark the fortunes of thought, and accredit the poet's
admiring line:&mdash;</p>

traveller, Feb. 9, 1869), "but in its vicinity, where we inspect the doings of
Greeks twenty-five to three thousand years ago, and of the Romans at a later
date. Their works are constructed out of the solid rock, and have withstood
the terrible earthquakes which have completely destroyed all traces of other
works. Among the interesting objects in the city is the cathedral, formerly
the temple of Minerva, which is a magnificent specimen of Doric architecture,
and has continued to be a place of worship through all the changes of
idolatry and Christianity, for twenty-five hundred years; the church of St.
Marcian here puts in its claim to have been the first church in Europe in
which Christian worship was celebrated. Full of interest are the catacombs
and the ancient prisons in the quarries from which the materials of Syracuse
were taken; here is the Ear of Dionysius, the tyrant of Syracuse, a prison
so arranged that every word spoken within it was re-echoed into his chamber,
where it is said he passed entire days listening to the complaints of his
victims. Here, too, is the famous fountain of Arethusa, one of the Nereads,
and whom Virgil reckons among the Sicilian nymphs, as the divinity who
inspired pastoral poetry. Syracuse was at different periods the residence
of Plato, Simonides, Zeno, and Cicero; it was the place where Hicetus first
propounded the true revolution of the earth; it was the birthplace of the
poets Theocritus and Moschus, and the philosopher Archimedes, who lost
his life at the capture of the city by the Romans."</p>

conclusion, but for the mental discipline and suggestive influences of the
tentative and verifying process. It was his purpose to create in his hearers
a disposition to prosecute philosophical researches of their own, and at the
same time to strengthen their ability of doing this with effect. This remark
is especially confirmed in the two dialogues, the Sophisticus and Politicus,
wherein he defends himself against reproaches seemingly made at the time.
To what does all this tend? Why do you stray so widely from your professed
topic? Could you not have reached the point by a shorter road? He
replies by distinctly proclaiming&mdash;that the process, with its improving influence
on the mind, stands first in his thoughts, the direct conclusion of the
inquiry only second; that the special topic which he discusses, though in
itself important, is nevertheless chosen primarily with a view to its effect in
communicating general method and dialectical aptitude, just as a schoolmaster,
when he gives out to his pupils a word to be spelt, looks mainly, not to
the exactness in spelling the particular word, but to their command of good
spelling generally. To form inquisitive testing minds, fond of philosophical
debate as a pursuit, and looking at opinions on the negative as on the positive
side, is the first object of most of Plato's dialogues: to teach positive
truth, is only a secondary object."&mdash;<cite>Grote's Plato, Vol. II, p. 399.</cite></p>

Philosophers of every Sect, illustrated with Portraits of many of them. Third

extracted from this history.</p>

<p class='footnote'><a name="Footnote_19" id="Footnote_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19"><span class='label'>19.</span></a> If his "Republic" and "Laws" hardly justify him against those who
accused him of having written a form of government which he could persuade
none to practise, it may be said, in his favor, that he gave laws to the
Syracusians and Cretans, refusing the like to the Ayreneans and Thebans,
saying, "It was difficult to prescribe laws to men in prosperity."</p>

<p class='footnote'><a name="Footnote_20" id="Footnote_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20"><span class='label'>20.</span></a> "The philosophy of the fourth century, B.&nbsp;C.," says Grote, "is peculiarly
valuable and interesting, not merely from its intrinsic speculative
worth,&mdash;from the originality and grandeur of its two principal heroes, Plato
and Aristotle,&mdash;from its coincidence with the full display of dramatic,
rhetorical, artistic genius, but also from a fourth reason not unimportant
because it is purely Hellenic; preceding the development of Alexandrian and
the amalgamation of Oriental veins of thought, with the inspirations of the
Academy and the Lyceum. The Orentes and the Jordan had not yet begun
to flow westward, and to impart their own color to the waters of Attica and
Latium. Not merely the real, but also the ideal, world present to the minds
of Plato and Aristotle, were purely Hellenic. Even during the century immediately
following, this had ceased to be fully true in respect to the philosophers
of Athens; and it became less and less true with each succeeding
century. New foreign centres of rhetoric and literature, Asiatic and Alexandrian
Hellenism, were fostered into importance by regal enactments.
Plato and Aristotle are thus the special representatives of genuine Hellenic
philosophy. The remarkable intellectual ascendancy acquired by them in
their day and maintained over succeeding centuries, was one main reason
why the Hellenic vein was enabled so long to maintain itself, though in impoverished
condition, against adverse influences from the East, ever increasing
in force. Plato and Aristotle outlasted all their pagan successors,&mdash;successors
at once less purely Hellenic and less gifted. And when St. Jerome,
near seven hundred and fifty years after the decease of Plato, commemorated
with triumph the victory of unlettered Christians over the accomplishments
and genius of paganism, he illustrated the magnitude of the victory by singling
out Plato and Aristotle as the representatives of vanquished philosophy."&mdash;<i>Grote's
Preface to Life of Plato.</i></p>

<p>Write to Walton, the British Boehmist, whose
letters interest by the information they contain
of himself and of his literary ventures. Any disciple
of the distinguished Mystic and student of his works,
living in foggy London in these times, is as significant
and noteworthy as are students of Hegel in St. Louis.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class='fnanchor'>21</a>
Mysticism is the sacred spark that has lighted the piety
and illuminated the philosophy of all places and times.
It has kindled especially and kept alive the profoundest
thinking of Germany and of the continent since Boehme's
first work, "The Aurora," appeared. Some of the deepest
thinkers since then have openly acknowledged their debt
to Boehme, or secretly borrowed without acknowledgment
their best illustrations from his writings. It is conceded
that his was one of the most original and subtlest
of minds, and that he has exercised a deeper influence
on the progress of thought than any one since Plotinus.
Before Bacon, before Newton, Swedenborg, Goethe, he
gave theories of nature, of the signatures of colors and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
forms, of the temperaments, the genesis of sex, the lapse
of souls, and of the elementary worlds. He stripped life
of its husk, and delivered its innermost essence. Instead
of mythology, he gave, if not science, the germs, if
nothing more. And when the depths of his thinking
have been fathomed by modern observers it will be soon
enough to speak of new revelations and arcana. His
teeming genius is the genuine mother of numberless
theories since delivered, from whose trunk the natural
sciences have branched forth and cropped out in scientific
systems. And like Swedenborg, it has borne a theology,
cosmology, illustrious theosophists and naturalists,&mdash;Law,
Leibnitz, Oken, Schelling, Goethe, Baader, and
other philosophers of Germany.</p>

<p>His learned English disciple and translator, Rev.
William Law, an author once highly esteemed and much
read by a former generation of pietists, says of him in
his Introduction to Boehme's Works:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whatsoever the great Hermes delivered in oracles,
or Pythagoras spoke by authority, or Socrates
or Aristotle affirmed, whatever divine Plato prophesied,
or Plotinus proved,&mdash;this and all this, or a far higher
and profounder philosophy, is contained in Boehme's
writings. And if there be any friendly medium that
can possibly reconcile these ancient differences between
the divine Wisdom that has fixed her place in Holy
Writ and her stubborn handmaid, natural Reason,&mdash;this
happy marriage of the Spirit of God and the soul, this
wonderful consent of discords in harmony,&mdash;we shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
find it in great measure in Boehme's books; only let not
the non or misunderstanding of the most rational reader
(if not a little sublimed above the sphere of common
reason) be imputed as a fault to this elevated philosopher,
no more than it was to the divine Plotinus, whose
scholars, even after much study, failed to comprehend
many of his doctrines."</p>

<p>Dr.&nbsp;Henry More, with a qualifying discrimination of
Law's estimate, writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jacob Boehme, I conceive, is to be reckoned in the
number of those whose imaginative faculty has the preeminence
above the rational, and though he was a holy
and good man, his natural complexion, notwithstanding,
was not destroyed but retained its property still, and
therefore his imagination being very busy about divine
things, he could not without a miracle fail of becoming
an enthusiast, and of receiving divine truths upon the
account of the strength and vigor of his fancy, which
being so well qualified with holiness and sanctity, proved
not unsuccessful in sundry apprehensions, but in others
it fared with him after the manner of men, the sagacity
of his imagination failing him, as well as the anxiety
of reason, does others of like integrity with himself."<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class='fnanchor'>22</a></p>

<h4>MR. WALTON'S LETTER.</h4>

<p>"By Theosophy I understand the true science of
Deity, Nature, and Creature. There are two classes
of theosophists, or true mystic philosophers. The one
such as Gichtel, the editor of the first German edition
of Jacob Boehme (whose letters and life in seven volumes
are now being translated into English, and if the
necessary funds can be raised they will be printed.)
Gichtel truly experimented the regenerated life of
Christianity according to the science thereof contained
in Boehme's writings; Bramwell fathomed Christianity
according to the simple <i xml:lang='la' lang='la'>prima facie</i> representation
thereof in the Gospel; in like manner in another form
Terstegan was also a high proficient therein, as were also
some of the ancient mystics and ascetics of France,
Spain, and Germany, as referred to in the Cyclopedia.
In the path of Gichtel there have been few and remote
followers.</p>

<p>"The other class is composed of those who have intellectually
fathomed the scope of Boehme's philosophy,
such as Freher, Law, Lee, Pordage, and others.</p>

<p>"As to the pretended independent 'seers,' outsiders
of Boehme's revelations,&mdash;whose names need not be
mentioned,&mdash;these are of course not to be admitted
into the category of the standard theologists, being
mere phantasmatists or visionaries, and who, though
uttering a great many good, and to some recondite
minds, surprising things, say in effect nothing but what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
is to be found in a much more solid and edifying form
in the writings of ancient classic divines and philosophers.</p>

<p>"As you will see by the accompanying printed papers,
I assert that for theosophy to have its true efficiency in
the world, there must not only be an intellectual acquaintance
with all nature, magical, mental, and physical,&mdash;all
which is present in every point of sense and
mental essence as revealed in Boehme,&mdash;but there
must be the actual realization of the translocated principles
of man's threefold being into their original co-relative
positions, and this in high confirmed reality;
which is only another expression for the theological and
alchymical term, 'regeneration.' And further, I say,
there must therewith be a profound knowledge of the
science and manifestation of animal magnetism.</p>

<p>"As to spiritism, of course at present theosophy has
nothing to do with it, except to contemplate the workings
of the magia of the fantasy of the grounds of
nature, as shown in it.</p>

<p>"I may just observe, that, if you are not acquainted
with the facts, you will find in V.&nbsp;Schubert, a German
Professor, some most interesting interpretations of and
deductions from Boehme's philosophy. He is a truly
ingenious elucidator of many of nature's secrets purely
from his conception of Boehme, and for general reading
in theosophy, is much more interesting than Baader,
who is very technical. But, as for myself, I cannot
derive from these or any other authors, what my understanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
requires that is beyond the manuscripts and
printed authors in my sole possession. Those I have,
contain the philosophy of nature and creation far more
lucidly and classically opened than is found in any
modern publication, for it is fundamentally demonstrated
therein; whereas in Hamburger and others, Boehme is
merely systematized, leaving his profundities in their
original abyss, like ore in the mine; whereas my
authors work it all out as far as they could in their day.</p>

<p>"I am and have been long engaged in preparing a compendium
of the true principles of all Being, and setting
forth all its stages up to the present time: all which is
a great mystery both to philosophy and science, as you
are doubtless aware. It has never yet been done, and
is indeed the grand desideratum. We have never yet
been able to reconcile the seeming or allowed declaration
of Scripture concerning the creation, with the Newtonian
philosophy, and the disclosures of modern chymic,
electric, and other sciences, so as to present a solid,
united, and convincing chain of the history of nature
from the first point of mental essence, to the present
state of physical things. And yet there must be such
a history and knowledge thereof, latent in the human
mind, and in the present daylight of theosophy and
physical science, capable of being educed thereout, in a
manner commending itself on the sight of it, with almost
the force of self-evidence, though in some points appearing
to clash with the seeming sense of Scripture.</p>

<p>"My labors are in the preparation of a series of symbolic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
illustrations (like Quarle's Emblems), whereby,
with the accompanying text, to produce this kind of
self-evident conviction. Of course I only open the procedure
to the present time. You may conceive the time
and labor and expense entailed by such an effort. Also
the fierce daily long discussions with an avowed and
actual rationalist opponent, whom I have for the purpose,
without which the truth or science cannot be made
to rise up apprehensively in the mind, and then only
in a mind in which theosophical and modern scientific
knowledge is, as it were, all in living activity, like a
magic looking-glass, wherein the images are all living,
and can be called forth instantly into visibility, as required
by the formula of each successive consideration
arising in the discussion, or during private meditation
and reading of Boehme, having an object in view.</p>

<p>"The science of all things lies in the Mind. In Newton
this plant of Jacob Boehme was largely cultivated
for his day; but now, by means of modern science, the
true history of all being can be brought forth as a complete
logical tree. And this is what the world wants, a
perfect philosophy and a perfect theology, as one only
sound of the word of nature. This was the divine object
in giving the last dispensation through Boehme, though
this was such a chaos yet unavoidable. From which
revelation of the ground and mystery of all things have
ensued all the grand regenerating discoveries of modern
science, as I have shown, and can now more fully
demonstrate. All date from that new opened puncture
of divine light in Boehme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
"I may just mention that I have a collection of all the
chief editions of Boehme, in German, Dutch, English,
and French, together with other elucidations whereby to
produce a new and most harmonious edition of Boehme.
Indeed such a thing cannot be accomplished without the
means in my possession. I also have at command with
me the literary and critical knowledge requisite to produce
a correct translation. For there are numerous
errors of sense in the German as in the English copies.
Indeed in some cases the sense of the passage is not
apprehensible. I trust the world will call for this
work before I die, in order that I may have the pleasure
of preparing, or rather directing, its accomplishment.
If I can procure a copy of the Cyclopedia you write
about, I shall be happy to present it to you.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class='fnanchor'>23</a></p>

<p class='letter-signature'>"I am, dear Sir, Yours very truly,</p>
<p class='align-right-indent'>"CHRISTOPHER WALTON.</p>
<p>"<span class="smcap">London,</span> 15th February, 1868."</p>

<p class='p1'>"The object of these publications," says Mr.&nbsp;Walton,
in his Prospectus, "and of their distribution in the
libraries of Great Britain and the United States, is to
induce and promote in a general manner, the study of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
pure metaphysical science, commencing at its root and
ground in Deity, thence through all those principles of
nature, eternal and temporal, of mind, spirit, and body,
which develop and concentre themselves in the form,
constitution, and support of man, as such, with a view
to render it subservient to its true end and design,
namely, the radical purification of theology throughout
the earth, and the final resolution of it into a fixed and
progressive science, and art in its kind, as contemplated
and provided for by Christianity."</p>

<p>For those interested in the history of Mysticism,
"Vaughan's Hours with the Mystics," published in
London, 1856, is an interesting volume, full of information
communicated by way of conversation, and in
an attractive style.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p class='footnote'><a name="Footnote_21" id="Footnote_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21"><span class='label'>21.</span></a>
A mystic book entitled "Quinquenergia, or Proposals for a new Practical
Theology," by Henry S. Sutton, was published in London in 1854. Mr.
Sutton is plainly tinctured with Boehme's theosophy, if not a disciple of his
as appears from his book. It is a volume of singular originality, and the
latest modern attempt at a Genesis from First Principles that I have met with.
It seems to have attracted few readers in England or in this country.</p>

<p class='footnote'><a name="Footnote_22" id="Footnote_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22"><span class='label'>22.</span></a> Students of Boehme have been few and far between. Edward Taylor
appears to have been Boehme's most distinguished disciple in England
before William Law. He published "A Compendious View of the Teutonic
Philosophy." London, 1670. Also Jacob Boehme's "Philosophy Unfolded
in divers Considerations and Demonstrations, and a Short Account of his
Life." London, 1690. John Sparrow published Boehme's Tracts and
Epistles. London, 1662. John Pordage's "Theologia Mystica, or the Mystic
Divinity of the Eternal Invisibles," London, 1683, is a rare volume.</p>

<p class='footnote'><a name="Footnote_23" id="Footnote_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23"><span class='label'>23.</span></a> The "Cyclopedia of Pure Christian Theology and Theosophic Science,"
is to contain the works of Boehme and his distinguished followers, Freher,
Gechtel, Pordage, Lee, Law, and others. The first volume is already printed
for private circulation, and deposited in the chief libraries of Europe and
America. It contains six hundred and eighty-eight closely printed pages,
chiefly of exposition and comment on Boehme, with biographical accounts
of Boehmists and of their works interspersed in voluminous notes.</p>

<h3><a name="CRABBE_ROBINSONS_DIARY" id="CRABBE_ROBINSONS_DIARY">CRABBE ROBINSON'S DIARY.</a></h3>

<p class='align-right-indent'><span class="smcap">Thursday, 19.</span></p>

<p>Crabbe Robinson's Diary is interesting; all
he tells us of Landor, Wordsworth, Coleridge, is
especially so. The book gives, perhaps, the best personal
and literary picture of the times in which he
lived. Few men had a wider circle of literary acquaintances
than the author. His book is a real addition to
contemporary literature, and shows the value of the
Diary for preserving in an attractive form what would
otherwise have been lost to the world. Robinson is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
no Boswell; he knew what to omit, what to commit
to writing, gave fair transcripts of what he saw, without
prepossession or prejudice.</p>

<h4>COLERIDGE.</h4>

<p>What Robinson tells of Coleridge is especially noticeable.</p>

<p>"I used," he says, "to compare him as a disputant
to a serpent,&mdash;easy to kill if you assume the offensive;
but if you attack him, his bite is mortal. Some time
after writing this, when I saw Madame De Stael, in
London, I asked her what she thought of him. She
replied, 'He is very great in monologue, but he has no
idea of dialogue.'"</p>

<p>Perhaps not. Yet with his equal, he would not have
been found wanting in this respect. Less English than
German in genius, he would have been on terms of
equality with thinkers of all times. But for his introduction
of German ideas into English literature, we
had waited a generation or more. He comprehended
and interpreted the ideas and methods of its great
thinkers. Better than most, he fulfilled Plato's canon,
that "only the gods discriminate and define." I find
him the most stimulating of modern British thinkers.
He had wider sympathies with pure thought, and cast
more piercing glances into its essence and laws than
any contemporary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
I must repeat my sense of obligation to him for the
quickening influence which the perusal of his pages
always awakens, at every paragraph making me his
debtor for a thought, an image, which it were worth
while to have lived for, so stimulating is his phrase to
imagination and reason alike; scarcely less to understanding
and memory. If his mysticism tinge his
speculations with its shifting hues, and one threads the
labyrinth into which he conducts with wonder and
amazement, he yet surrenders unreservedly to his
guide, sure of coming to the light, with memorable
experiences to reward him for the adventure.</p>

<p>His appreciation of the Greek, as of the Teutonic
genius, is the more remarkable when we consider how
rarely his countrymen have comprehended foreign
ideas; and that Shakespeare even found in him his
first interpreter.</p>

<p>In his Literary Remains, we find these remarkable
notes on the Greek drama:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is truly singular that Plato&mdash;whose philosophy
and religion were both exotic at home, and a mere opposition
to the finite in all things, genuine prophet and
anticipator of the protestant era&mdash;should have given
in his dialogue of the Banquet a justification of our
Shakespeare. For he relates that, when all the other
guests had either dispersed or fallen asleep, Socrates
only, together with Aristophanes and Agathon, remained
awake; and that, while he continued to drink
with them out of a large goblet, he compelled them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
though most reluctantly, to admit that it was the business
of one and the same genius to excel in tragic and
comic poetry; or, that the tragic poet ought, at the same
time, to contain within himself the powers of comedy.
Now, as this was certainly repugnant to the entire
theory of the ancient critics, and contrary to all their
experience, it is evident that Plato must have fixed the
eye of his contemplation on the innermost essentials of
the drama, abstracted from conditions of age and country.
In another passage he even adds the reason, namely:
that opposites illustrate each other's nature, and in their
struggle draw forth the strength of the combatants,
and display the conquered as sovereign even in the
territories of the rival power."</p>

<p>Again: "The tragic poet idealizes his characters by
giving to the spiritual part of our nature a more decided
preponderance over animal cravings and impulses than
is met with in real life; the comic poet idealizes his
characters by making the animal the governing power,
and the intellectual the mere instrument. But as tragedy
is not a collection of virtues and perfections, but
takes care only that the vices and imperfections shall
spring from the passions, errors, and prejudices which
arise of the soul; so neither is comedy a mere
crowd of vices and follies, but whatever qualities it
represents, even though they are in a certain sense
amiable, it still displays them as having their origin in
some dependence on our lower nature, accompanied
with a defect in true freedom of spirit and self-subsistence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
and subject to that unconnection by contradiction
of inward being, to which all folly is owing."</p>

<p>Coleridge, while writing this masterly analysis of the
seats of the tragic and comic in man's inner being,
and with the text of Plato and of Shakespeare before
him, must have been contemplating the springs of
his own defects, the strength twinned with his weaknesses,
which ever made him the helpless demigod he
was; aspiring ever, yet drawn downward by the leash
of his frailties, as tragic a character as any that Shakespeare
himself has drawn.</p>

<p>"Learned Selden," learned in civil and political
wisdom as were few of his great contemporaries.
If his book of Table Talk has less repute than Bacon's
famous Essays, like that, opened anywhere, it displays
the author's eminent discretion, his comprehensive understanding,
apposite illustration of his theme. His
homely, familiar manner, has its attractions as well for
the scholar as for the common reader; pregnant as are
his sentences with his great good sense, rare learning,
bringing abstruse subjects home to the affairs of life in
a style at once perspicuous and agreeable. "He was a
person," says Lord Clarendon, "whom no character can
flatter, or transmit in any expressions equal to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
merit. He was of such stupendous learning in all kinds
of languages that a man would have thought he had
been entirely conversant among books, and had never
spent an hour but in reading and writing. Yet his humanity,
courtesy, and affability were such, that he would
have been thought to have been bred in the best courts,
but that his good-nature, charity, and delight in doing
good, and in communicating all he knew, exceeded his
breeding. His style in all his writings seems harsh, and
sometimes obscure, which is not wholly to be imputed
to the abstruse subjects of which he commonly treated,
but to a little undervaluing of style, and too much propensity
to the language of antiquity; but in his conversation
he was the most clear discourser, and had the
best faculty of making hard things easy, and of presenting
them to the understanding, of any man that
hath been known."</p>

<p>Coleridge, who never let any person of eminence, in
thought or erudition, escape his attention, says: "There
is more weighty bullion sense in this book (The Table
Talk) than I ever found in the same number of pages
of any uninspired writer."</p>

not easily discriminated. Still, each preserves its
distinctive traits under all differences, neither being

<p>To Walden with May, who takes a pencil sketch for
her collection. Thoreau's hermitage has disappeared,
and the grounds are overgrown with pines and
sumac, leaving the site hardly traceable. The shores
of Walden are as sylvan as ever near Thoreau's haunt,
but have been shorn of wood on the southern side. No
spot of water in these parts has a more interesting
history. It well deserved the poet's praises while
Thoreau dwelt on its shores.</p>

<p>"When I first paddled a boat on Walden," wrote
Thoreau, "it was completely surrounded by thick and
lofty pine and oak woods, and in some spots, coves of
grape vines had run over the trees and formed bowers
under which a boat could pass. The hills which form
its shore are so steep, and the woods on them so high,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
that as you looked down the pond from the west end, it
had the appearance of an amphitheatre. For some
kind of sylvan spectacle, I have spent many an hour
when I was younger, floating over its surface as the
zephyr willed, having paddled my boat to the middle,
and lying on my back across the seats in a summer
forenoon, and looking into the sky, dreaming awake
until I was aroused by my boat touching the sand,
and I arose to see what shore my fates had impelled
me to. In these days, when idleness was the most
attractive and productive industry, many a forenoon
have I stolen away, preferring to spend thus the most
valued part of the day. For I was rich, if not in
money, in sunny hours and summer days, and spent
them lavishly. Nor do I regret that I did not waste
more of them behind a counter, or in a workshop, or
at the teacher's desk, in which last two places I have
spent many of them.</p>

<p>"I must say that I do not know what made me
leave the pond. I left it as unaccountably as I went to
it. To speak sincerely, I went there because I had got
ready to go. I left it for the same reason.</p>

<p>"These woods! why do I not feel their being cut
more freely? Does it not affect me nearly? The axe
can deprive me of much. Concord is sheared of its
pride. I am certain by the loss attached to my native
town in consequence, one and a main link is broken. I
shall go to Walden less frequently.</p>

<p>"Look out what window I will, my eyes rest in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
distance on a forest. Is this circumstance of no value?
Why such pains in old countries to plant gardens and
parks? A certain sample of wild nature, a certain
primitiveness? The towns thus bordered with a fringe
and tasselled border, each has its preservers. Methinks
the town should have more supervisors to control its
parks than it has. It concerns us all whether these
proprietors choose to cut down all the woods this winter
or not. I love to look at Ebby Hubbard's oaks and
pines on the hillside from Brister's Hill, and am thankful
that there is one old miser who will not sell or cut his
woods, though it is said that they are wasting. 'It is
an ill wind that blows nobody any good.'"</p>

<p>"Walk round Walden Pond these warm winter days.
The wood-chopper finds that the wood cuts easier than
when it had the frost in it, though it does not split so
readily. Thus every change in the weather has its influence
on him, and is appreciated by him in a peculiar
way. The wood-cutter and his practices and experiences
are more to be attended to; his accidents, perhaps,
more than any others, should mark the epochs in
a winter's day. Now that the Indian is gone, he
stands nearest to nature. Who has written the history
of his day? How far still is the writer of books from
the man, his old playmate, it may be, who chops in the
woods? There are ages between them. Homer refers
to the progress of the wood-cutter's work to mark the
time of day on the plains of Troy. And the inference
from such premises commonly is, that he lived in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
more primitive state of society than the present. But
I think this is a mistake. Like proves like in all ages,
and the fact that I myself should take pleasure in preferring
the simple and peaceful labors which are always
proceeding; that the contrast itself always attracts the
civilized poet to what is rudest and most primitive in
his contemporaries;&mdash;all this rather proves a certain
interval between the poet and the wood-chopper, whose
labor he refers to, than an unusual nearness to him,
on the principle that familiarity breeds contempt. Homer
is to be subjected to a very different kind of criticism
from any he has received. That reader who most
fully appreciates the poet, and derives the greater
pleasure from his work, lives in circumstances most
like those of the poet himself.</p>

<p>"This afternoon I throw off my outside coat, a mild
spring day. I must hie me to the meadows. The air
is full of bluebirds. The ground is almost entirely
bare. The villagers are out in the sun, and every man
is happy whose work takes him out-of-doors. I go by
Sleepy Hollow towards the great fields. I lean over a
rail to hear what is in the air, liquid with the bluebird's
warble. My life partakes of infinity. The air is deep
as our natures. Is the drawing in of this vital air attended
with no more glorious results than I witness?
The air is a velvet cushion against which I press my
ear. I go forth to make new demands on life. I wish
to begin this summer well. To do something in it
worthy and wise. To transcend my daily routine and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
that of my townsmen, to have my immortality now,&mdash;that
it be in the quality of my daily life,&mdash;to pay the
greatest price, the greatest tax of any man in Concord,
and enjoy the most! I will give all I am for my nobility.
I will pay all my days for my success. I pray
that the life of this spring and summer may be fair in
my memory. May I dare as I have never done. May
I purify myself anew as with fire and water, soul and
body. May my melody not be wanting to the season.
May I gird myself to be a hunter of the beautiful, that
nought escape me. May I attain to a youth never attained.
I am eager to report the glory of the universe:
may I be worthy to do it; to have got through regarding
human values, so as not to be distracted from
regarding divine values. It is reasonable that a man
should be something worthier at the end of the year
than he was at the beginning."</p>

<p>A delightful volume might be compiled from Thoreau's
Journals by selecting what he wrote at a certain date
annually, thus giving a calendar of his thoughts on that
day from year to year. Such a book would be instructive
in many ways,&mdash;to the naturalist, the farmer,
woodman, scholar; and as he was wont to weave
a sensible moral into his writings, it would prove
a suggestive treatise on morals and religion also.
Not every preacher takes his text from his time, his
own eyes, ears, and feet, in his sensible, superior
manner.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_IDEAL_CHURCH" id="THE_IDEAL_CHURCH">THE IDEAL CHURCH.</a></h3>

<p class='align-right-indent'><span class="smcap">Monday, 13.</span></p>

<p>The divinity students come according to appointment
and pass the day. It is gratifying to be
sought by thoughtful young persons, especially by
young divines, and a hopeful sign when graduates of our
schools set themselves to examining the foundations of
their faith; the ceilings alike with underpinnings of the
world's religious ideas and institutions, their genesis
and history. Plainly, the drift of thinking here in New
England, if not elsewhere, is towards a Personal Theism,
inclusive of the faiths of all races, embodying the substance
of their Sacred Books, with added forms and
instrumentalities suited to the needs of our time. The
least curious observer (I tell my visitors) cannot fail
to see that at no previous period in our religious history,
had so profound and anxious inquiries been made into
the springs and foundations of spiritual truths. The
signs of our time indicate that we are on the eve of a
recasting of the old forms. Always there had been two
divisions in the theological as in the political and social
spheres,&mdash;the conservative and the radically progressive.
This division marks itself at the present, so
sweeping is the wave of religious speculation, not only
among professed Christians, but among the thoughtful
outside of churches. Wherever we look, earnest men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
are pondering in what manner they can best serve God
and man.</p>

<p>Let us discriminate religious truth from mere opinions.
The fruit of temperament, culture, individuality,
these are wont to be local, narrow, exclusive.
The planting of a church to which all men can subscribe,
demands a common bond of sympathy, the
feeling of brotherhood, mutual respect, peculiarities,
culture, respect for old and young. Such is the bond
of union for the New Church. The essence of all
creeds is God, Personal, Incarnate, without whom a
church and divine worship were impossible. Not to
enter into the metaphysics of creeds and philosophy of
systems, let us sketch an outline of our Ideal Church.</p>

<p>Our forms are of the past, not American. Times
modify forms. The world of thought moves fast; what
is good for one time may ill suit another. The culture
of past ages is stealing into our present thought, deepening,
widening it. Sects are provincial, geographical;
the coming church is to speak to every need, every
power of humanity. A revelation is not a full revelation
which fails to touch the whole man, quicken all his
powers into beauty and strength of exercise.</p>

<p>First, of the architecture. Let this represent the
essential needs of the soul. Our dwelling-houses best
typify the tender domesticities of life; let the church
edifice embody more of this familiar love. In the ordering
of the congregation, let age have precedence;
give the front seats to the eldest members; let families
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
sit together, so that the element of family affection
be incorporated in the worship. An arrangement
of the pews in semicircles will bring all more
nearly at equal gradation of distance from the speaker,
whose position is best slightly elevated above the congregation.
Pictures and statues, representing to the senses
the grand events of the religious history of the past,
may be an essential part of the church furniture; the
statues embodying the great leaders of religious thought
of all races. These are not many; the world owes its
progress to a few persons. The divine order gives one
typical soul to a race. Let us respect all races and
creeds, as well as our own; read and expound their
sacred books like our Scriptures. Constituting a body
of comparative divinity, each is a contribution to the
revelation made to mankind from time to time. Could
any one well remain exclusive or local in his thought
from such studies and teachings? Christianity, as the
religion of the most advanced nations, is fast absorbing
the beauty, the thought, the truth of other religions,
and this fact should find expression also.</p>

<p>Let there be frequent interchange of preachers and
teachers, since few can speak freshly to the same congregation
for every Sunday in the year; only the
freshest thought, the purest sentiments, were their due.
Let the services be left to the speaker's selection. Let
the music be set to the best lyrical poetry of all ages,
poems sometimes read or recited as part of the services.
As for prayer, it may be spoken from an overflowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
heart, may be silent, or omitted at the option
of the minister.</p>

<p>Let the children have a larger share in the religious
services than hitherto; one half of the day be appropriated
to them. Who can speak to children can
address angels; true worship is childlike. "All nations,"
said Luther, "the Jews especially, school their
children more faithfully than Christians. And this is
one reason why religion is so fallen. For till its hopes
of strength and potency are ever committed to the generation
that is coming on to the stage. And if this is
neglected in its youth, it fares with Christianity as with
a garden that is neglected in the spring-time. There
is no greater obstacle in the way of piety than neglect
in the training of the young. If we would reinstate
religion in its former glory, we must improve and
elevate the children, as it was done in days of old."<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class='fnanchor'>24</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>
<h4>COLLYER.</h4>

<p>Our young divines may study Beecher and Collyer, if
they will learn the types of preaching which the people
most enjoy and flock to hear. Collyer, without pretension
to eloquence, is most eloquent in his plain, homely,
human way. He meets his audience as the iron he
once smote, and his words have the ring of true steel.
He speaks from crown to toe, and with a delightful
humor that gives his rhetoric almost a classic charm, his
Yorkshire accent adding to the humane quality of his
thought. There is as little of scholarly pretence as of
priestly assumption in his address, and he makes his
way by his placid strength, clear intelligence, breadth
of sympathy, putting the rhetoric of the schools to the
blush.</p>

<h4>BEECHER.</h4>

<p>I once entered Beecher's church with a friend who
was not often seen in such sanctuaries. Aisles, body,
galleries, every slip, every chair, all were occupied,
many left standing. The praise, the prayer, the christening,&mdash;there
were a dozen babes presented for baptism,&mdash;all
were devout, touching, even to tears at
times. I know I wept, while my friend was restive,
fancying himself, as he declared, in some Pagan fane.
The services all seemed becoming, however. Here was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
no realm of Drowsy Head. The preaching was the
more effective for its playfulness, point, strength,
pertinency. Coming from the heart, the doctrine
found the hearts of its hearers. The preacher showed
his good sense, too, in omitting the trite phrases and
traditions, speaking straight to his points in plain,
homely speech, that carried the moral home to its mark.
It was refreshing to get a touch of human nature, the
preaching so often failing in this respect. The speaker
took his audience along with him by his impetuosity,
force of momentum, his wit playing about his argument,
gathering power of persuasion, force of statement
as he passed. His strong sense, broad humanity,
abounding animal spirits, humor, anecdote, perhaps
explain the secret of his power and popularity.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p class='footnote'><a name="Footnote_24" id="Footnote_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24"><span class='label'>24.</span></a> It appears from "Letchford's Plain Dealings concerning New England,"
that the church in Concord was the first in the colony that adopted the
practice of catechising the children on Sundays. "The unmarried people,"
he says, "were also required to answer questions, after which Mr.&nbsp;Bulkeley
gave expositions and made applications to the whole congregation." And
this practice soon found its way into all the churches, became a part of the
Sunday service in the church, in the family at last. From these it passed,
subsequently, into the schools, a part of Saturday forenoon being devoted
to recitations, and where the parents were of different persuasions, the
teachers heard these from the Westminster, or Church of England catechisms,
accordingly. Some of us remember committing both to memory,
and having the benefit of so much comparative divinity as these furnished
at that early age.</p>

<p class='align-right-indent'><span class="smcap">Sunday, 19.</span></p>

<p>Our instincts are idealists. Contradicting impressions
of the senses, they prompt us forth to
the noblest aims and endeavors. Aspirants for the best,
they prick us forward to its attainment, the more
successfully as our theories of life lift us above the
planes of precedent and routine, whereon the senses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
confine us, to the mount of vision and of renovating
ideas. Nor are these too lofty or too beautiful to be
unattainable. 'Tis when practice strays wide and falls
below that they appear visionary and fall into disrepute.
Only those who mount the summits command
the valleys at their base.</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>"When we ourselves from our own selves do quit,</p>
<p class='verse'>And each thing else, then an all-spreading love</p>
<p class='verse'>To the vast universe our soul doth fit,</p>
<p class='verse'>Makes us half equal to all-seeing Jove;</p>
<p class='verse'>Our mighty wings, high-stretched, then clapping light,</p>
<p class='verse'>We brush the stars, and make them seem more bright."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Enthusiasm is essential to the successful attainment
of any high endeavor; without which incentive
one is not sure of his equality to the humblest undertaking
even. And he attempts little worth living for if
he expects completing his task in an ordinary life-time.
His translation is for the continuance of his work here
begun, but for whose completion time and opportunity
were all too narrow and brief. Himself is the success
or failure. Step by step one climbs the pinnacles of
excellence; life itself is but the stretch for that mountain
of holiness. Opening here with humanity, 'tis the
aiming at divinity in ever-ascending circles of aspiration
and endeavor. Who ceases to aspire, dies. Our pursuits
are our prayers; our ideals our gods. And the
more persistent our endeavors to realize these, the less
distant they seem. They were not gods could we approach
them at once. We were the atheists of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
senses without them. All of beauty and of beatitude
we conceive and strive for, ourselves are to be sometime.
Man becomes godlike as he strives for divinity, and
divinity ever stoops to put on humanity and deify mankind.
Character is mythical. The excellent are unapproachable
save by like excellence. A person every
way intelligible falls short of our conception of greatness;
he ceases to be great in our eyes. God is not
God in virtue of attributes, but of the mystery surrounding
these. Could we see through the cloud that
envelopes our apprehensions, he were here, and ourselves
apparent in his likeness. "God," says Plato, "is ineffable,
hard to be defined, and having been discovered,
to make fully known."</p>

<div class='container-center'>
<div class='poetry'>
<p class='verse'>"He is above the sphere of our esteem,</p>
<p class='verse'>And is best known in not defining him."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Any attempted definition would include whatsoever
is embraced within our notion of Personality,&mdash;would
exhaust our knowledge of nature and of ourselves.
Only as we become One Personally with Him do we
know Him and partake of his attributes.</p>

<p>"In the soul of man," says Berkeley, "prior and
superior to intellect, there is a somewhat of a higher
nature, by virtue of which we are one, and by means of
which we are most clearly joined to the Deity. And as
by our intellect we touch the divine intellect, even so
by our oneness, 'the very flower of our essence,' as
Proclus expresses it, we touch the First One. Existence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
and One are the same. And consequently, our
minds participate so far of existence as they do of
unity. But it should seem the personality is the indivisible
centre of the soul, or mind, which is a monad,
so far forth as she is a person. Therefore Person is
really that which exists, inasmuch as it partakes of the
divine unity. Number is no object of sense, but an
act of the mind. The same thing in a different conception
is one or many. Comprehending God and the
creatures in one general notion, we may say that all
things together make one universe. But if we should
say that all things make one God, this would indeed be
an erroneous notion of God, but would not amount to
atheism, so long as mind, or intellect, was admitted to
be the governing part. It is, nevertheless, more respectful,
and consequently the truer notion of God, to
suppose Him neither made up of parts, nor himself to
be a part of any whole whatsoever."</p>

<p class='ad-reviews'>"The moral qualities of Mr.&nbsp;Alcott have probably more to do with the secret
of his influence than his peculiar mental endowments. Every page of his writings
evinces a singularly pure and unworldly character. They appear more like
leaves torn from some fragrant antique volume, than the products of this competitive,
rapacious age. They transport us to some peaceful island beyond the
reach of the ambitions and rivalries of the day. He lives in a serene atmosphere,
free from all secular perturbations. No earthly stain discolors the spotless
whiteness of his soul. It is no wonder that he is listened to in speechless reverence
by an esoteric circle, and that his words are clothed with an authority
beyond the power of gaudy rhetoric or purely intellectual demonstration."&mdash;<i>New
York Tribune.</i></p>

<p class='no-indent p1'>LITTLE WOMEN. By <span class="smcap">Louisa M. Alcott</span>.
In Two Parts. Price of each $1.50.</p>

<p class='ad-reviews p05'>"Simply one of the most charming little books that have fallen into our hands
for many a day. There is just enough of sadness in it to make it true to life, while
it is so full of honest work and whole-souled fun, paints so lively a picture of a home
in which contentment, energy, high spirits, and real goodness make up for the lack
of money, that it will do good wherever it finds its way. Few will read it without
lasting profit."&mdash;<cite>Hartford Courant.</cite></p>

<p class='ad-reviews'>"<span class="smcap">Little Women.</span> By Louisa M. Alcott. We regard these volumes as two
of the most fascinating that ever came into a household. Old and young read them
with the same eagerness. Lifelike in all their delineations of time, place, and
character, they are not only intensely interesting, but full of a cheerful morality,
that makes them healthy reading for both fireside and the Sunday school. We
think we love "Jo" a little better than all the rest, her genius is so happy tempered
with affection."&mdash;<cite>The Guiding Star.</cite></p>

<p class='ad-reviews'>The following verbatim copy of a letter from a "little woman" is a specimen
of many which enthusiasm for her book has dictated to the author of "Little
Women:"&mdash;</p>

<p class='ad-reviews align-right-indent'>&mdash;&mdash;March 12, 1870.</p>

<p class='ad-reviews'><span class="smcap">Dear Jo, or Miss Alcott</span>,&mdash;We have all been reading "Little Women," and
we liked it so much I could not help wanting to write to you. We think <em>you</em> are
perfectly splendid; I like you better every time I read it. We were all so disappointed
about your not marrying Laurie; I cried over that part,&mdash;I could not help
it. We all liked Laurie ever so much, and almost killed ourselves laughing over
the funny things you and he said.</p>

<p class='ad-reviews'>We are six sisters and two brothers; and there were so many things in "Little
Women" that seemed so natural, especially selling the rags.</p>

<p class='ad-reviews'>Eddie is the oldest; then there is Annie (our Meg), then Nelly (that's me),
May and Milly (our Beths), Rosie, Rollie, and dear little Carrie (the baby).
Eddie goes away to school, and when he comes home for the holidays we have
lots of fun, playing cricket, croquet, base ball, and every thing. If you ever want
to play any of those games, just come to our house, and you will find plenty children
to play with you.</p>

<p class='ad-reviews'>If you ever come to &mdash;&mdash;, I do wish you would come and see us,&mdash;we would
like it so much.</p>

<p class='ad-reviews'>I have named my doll after you, and I hope she will try and deserve it.</p>

<p class='ad-reviews'>I do wish you would send me a picture of you. I hope your health is better,
and you are having a nice time.</p>

<p class='ad-reviews'>If you write to me, please direct &mdash;&mdash; Ill. All the children send their love.</p>

<p class='ad-reviews center'>With ever so much love, from your affectionate friend,</p>

M. Alcott.</span> With Illustrations. Price $1.50.</a></p>

<p class='ad-reviews p1'>"Miss Alcott has a faculty of entering into the lives and feelings of children
that is conspicuously wanting in most writers who address them; and to this cause,
to the consciousness among her readers that they are hearing about people like
themselves, instead of abstract qualities labelled with names, the popularity of her
books is due. Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy are friends in every nursery and schoolroom,
and even in the parlor and office they are not unknown; for a good story is
interesting to older folks as well, and Miss Alcott carries on her children to manhood
and womanhood, and leaves them only on the wedding-day."&mdash;<i>Mrs. Sarah
J. Hale in Godey's Ladies' Book.</i></p>

<p class='ad-reviews'>"We are glad to see that Miss Alcott is becoming naturalized among us as a
writer, and cannot help congratulating ourselves on having done something to
bring about the result. The author of 'Little Women' is so manifestly on the
side of all that is 'lovely, pure, and of good report' in the life of women, and
writes with such genuine power and humor, and with such a tender charity and
sympathy, that we hail her books with no common pleasure. 'An Old-Fashioned
Girl' is a protest from the other side of the Atlantic against the manners of the
creature which we know on this by the name of 'the Girl of the Period;' but the
attack is delivered with delicacy as well as force."&mdash;<cite>The London Spectator.</cite></p>

<p class='ad-reviews'>"A charming little book, brimful of the good qualities of intellect and heart
which made 'Little Women' so successful. The 'Old-Fashioned Girl' carries
with it a teaching specially needed at the present day, and we are glad to know it
is even already a decided and great success."&mdash;<cite>New York Independent.</cite></p>

<p class='ad-reviews'>"Miss Alcott's new story deserves quite as great a success as her famous "Little
Women," and we dare say will secure it. She has written a book which child
and parent alike ought to read, for it is neither above the comprehension of the one,
nor below the taste of the other. Her boys and girls are so fresh, hearty, and natural,
the incidents of her story are so true to life, and the tone is so thoroughly
healthy, that a chapter of the 'Old-Fashioned Girl' wakes up the unartificial better
life within us almost as effectually as an hour spent in the company of good, honest,
sprightly children. The Old-Fashioned Girl, Polly Milton, is a delightful
creature!"&mdash;<cite>New York Tribune.</cite></p>

<p class='ad-reviews'>"Gladly we welcome the 'Old-Fashioned Girl' to heart and home! Joyfully
we herald her progress over the land! Hopefully we look forward to the time
when our young people, following her example, will also be old-fashioned in purity
of heart and simplicity of life, thus brightening like a sunbeam the atmosphere
around them."&mdash;<cite>Providence Journal.</cite></p>

By <span class="smcap">Louisa M. Alcott</span>. With Illustrations. Price
$1.50.</p>

<p class='ad-reviews p05'>"The gods are to be congratulated upon the success of the Alcott experiment,
as well as all childhood, young and old, upon the singular charm of the little men
and little women who have run forth from the Alcott cottage, children of a maiden
whose genius is beautiful motherhood."&mdash;<cite>The Examiner.</cite></p>

<p class='ad-reviews'>"No true-hearted boy or girl can read this book without deriving benefit from
the perusal; nor, for that matter, will it the least injure children of a larger growth
to endeavor to profit by the examples of gentleness and honesty set before them in
its pages. What a delightful school 'Jo' did keep! Why, it makes us want to
live our childhood's days over again, in the hope that we might induce some kind-hearted
female to establish just such a school, and might prevail upon our parents
to send us, 'because it was cheap.'&hellip; We wish the genial authoress a long
life in which to enjoy the fruits of her labor, and cordially thank her, in the name
of our young people, for her efforts in their behalf."&mdash;<cite>Waterbury American.</cite></p>

<p class='ad-reviews'>"Miss Alcott, whose name has already become a household word among little
people, will gain a new hold upon their love and admiration by this little book.
It forms a fitting sequel to 'Little Women,' and contains the same elements of
popularity.&hellip; We expect to see it even more popular than its predecessor, and
shall heartily rejoice at the success of an author whose works afford so much hearty
and innocent enjoyment to the family circle, and teach such pleasant and wholesome
lessons to old and young."&mdash;<cite>N.&nbsp;Y.&nbsp;Times.</cite></p>

<p class='ad-reviews'>"Suggestive, truthful, amusing, and racy, in a certain simplicity of style which
very few are capable of producing. It is the history of only six months' school-life
of a dozen boys, but is full of variety and vitality, and the having girls
with the boys is a charming novelty, too. To be very candid, this book is so
thoroughly good that we hope Miss Alcott will give us another in the same genial
vein, for she understands children and their ways."&mdash;<cite>Phil. Press.</cite></p>

<p class='ad-reviews'><span class="smcap">Dear Miss Alcott</span>,&mdash;We have just finished "Little Men," and like it so
much that we thought we would write and ask you to write another book sequel to
"Little Men," and have more about Laurie and Amy, as we like them the best.
We are the Literary Club, and we got the idea from "Little Women." We have
a paper two sheets of foolscap and a half. There are four of us, two cousins and
my sister and myself. Our assumed names are: Horace Greeley, President; Susan
B. Anthony, Editor; Harriet B. Stowe, Vice-President; and myself, Anna C.
Ritchie, Secretary. We call our paper the "Saturday Night," and we all write
stories and have reports of sermons and of our meetings, and write about the
queens of England. We did not know but you would like to hear this, as the
idea sprang from your book; and we thought we would write, as we liked your
book so much. And now, if it is not too much to ask of you, I wish you would
answer this, as we are very impatient to know if you will write another book; and
please answer soon, as Miss Anthony is going away, and she wishes very much to
hear from you before she does. If you write, please direct to &mdash;&mdash; Street, Brooklyn,
